INTRODUCTION. THE BOY COMPANIES</h3></div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The first systematic
investigation into the history of the companies was that of F.
G. Fleay, which, after tentative sketches in his <i>Shakespeare
Manual</i> (1876) and <i>Life and Work of Shakespeare</i>
(1886), took shape in his <i>Chronicle History of the
Stage</i> (1890). Little is added by the compilations of A.
Albrecht, <i>Das Englische Kindertheater</i> (1883), H. Maas,
<i>Die Kindertruppen</i> (1901) and <i>Äussere Geschichte
der Englischen Theatertruppen</i> (1907), and J. A. Nairn,
<i>Boy-Actors under the Tudors and Stewarts</i> (<i>Trans.
of Royal Soc. of Lit.</i> xxxii). W. W. Greg, <i>Henslowe’s
Diary</i> (1904–8), made a careful study of all the companies
which had relations with Philip Henslowe, and modified or
corrected many of Fleay’s results. An account of the chief
London companies is in A. H. Thorndike, <i>Shakespeare’s
Theater</i> (1916), and utilizes some new material collected
in recent years. W. Creizenach, <i>Schauspiele der Englischen
Komödianten</i> (1889), and E. Herz, <i>Englische Schauspieler
und Englisches Schauspiel</i> (1903), have summarized the
records of the travels of English actors in Germany. C. W.
Wallace, besides his special work on the Chapel, has published
the records of several theatrical lawsuits in <i>Advance Sheets
from Shakespeare, the Globe, and Blackfriars</i> (1909), in
<i>Nebraska University Studies</i>, ix (1909), 287; x (1910),
261; xiii (1913), 1, and in <i>The Swan Theatre and the Earl
of Pembroke’s Servants</i> (1911, <i>Englische Studien</i>,
xliii. 340); the present writer has completed the information
drawn from the <i>Chamber Accounts</i> in P. Cunningham’s
<i>Extracts from the Accounts of the Revels at Court</i> (1842)
by articles in <i>M. L. R.</i> ii (1906), 1; iv (1909), 153
(cf. App. B); and a number of documents, new and old, including
the texts of all the patents issued to companies, have been
carefully edited in vol. i of the <i>Collections of the Malone
Society</i> (1907–11). Finally, J. T. Murray, <i>English
Dramatic Companies</i> (1910), has collected the published
notices of performances in the provinces, added others from the
municipal archives of Barnstaple, Bristol, Coventry, Dover,
Exeter, Gloucester, Marlborough, Norwich, Plymouth, Shrewsbury,
Southampton, Winchester, and York, and on the basis of these
constructed valuable accounts of all the London and provincial
companies between 1558 and 1642. Most of the present chapter
was written before Murray’s book appeared, but it has been
carefully revised with the aid of his new material. I have
not thought it necessary to refer to my original provincial
sources, where they are included in his convenient Appendix
G, but in using his book it should be borne in mind that he
has made a good many omissions in carrying data from this
Appendix to the tables of provincial visits, which he gives
for each company. For a few places I have had the advantage of
sources not drawn upon by Murray, and these should be treated
as the references for any facts as regards such places not
discoverable in Murray’s Appendix.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> They are:&mdash;for Belvoir
and other houses of the Earls of Rutland, <i>Rutland MSS.</i>
(<i>Hist. MSS.</i>), iv. 260; for the house of Richard Bertie
and his wife the Duchess of Suffolk at Grimsthorpe, <i>Ancaster
MSS.</i> (<i>Hist. MSS.</i>), 459; for Wollaton, the house of
Francis Willoughby, <i>Middleton MSS.</i> (<i>Hist. MSS.</i>),
446; for Maldon and Saffron Walden in Essex, A. Clark’s extracts
in <i>10 Notes and Queries</i>, vii. 181, 342, 422; viii. 43;
xii. 41; for Newcastle-on-Tyne, G. B. Richardson, <i>Reprints
of Rare Tracts</i>, vol. iii, and <i>10 N. Q.</i> xii. 222;
for Reading, <i>Hist. MSS.</i> xi. 177; for Oxford, F. S.
Boas in <i>Fortnightly Review</i> (Aug. 1913; Aug. 1918; May
1920); for Stratford, J. O. Halliwell, <i>Stratford-upon-Avon
in the Time of the Shakespeares, illustrated by Extracts from
the Council-Books</i> (1864); for Weymouth, H. J. Moule,
<i>Weymouth and Melcombe Regis Documents</i> (1883), 136; for
Dunwich, <i>Various Collections</i> (<i>Hist. MSS.</i>), vii.
82; for Aldeburgh, Suffolk, C. C. Stopes, <i>William Hunnis</i>,
314. References for a few other scattered items are in the
foot-notes. The warning should be given that the dates assigned
to some of the provincial performances are approximate, and
may be in error within a year or so either way. For this there
are more reasons than one. The zealous antiquaries who have
made extracts from local records have not realized that precise
dates might be of value, and have often named a year without
indicating whether it represents the calendar year (Circumcision
style) or the calendar year (Annunciation style) in which a
performance fell, or the calendar year in which a regnal,
mayoral, or accounting year, in which the performance fell,
began or ended. When they are clearly dealing with accounting
years, they do not always indicate whether these ended at
Michaelmas or at some other date. They sometimes give only the
year of a performance, when they might have given, precisely or
approximately, the month and day of the month as well. But it is
fair to add that the accounts of City Chamberlains and similar
officers, from which the notices of plays are generally derived,
are not always so kept as to render precise dating feasible.
Some accountants specify the days, others the weeks to which
their entries relate; others put their entries in chronological
order and date some of them, so that it is possible to fix the
dates of the rest within limits; others again render accounts
analysed under heads, grouping all payments to players perhaps
under a head of ‘Gifts and Rewards’, and in such cases you
cannot be sure that the companies are even entered in the order
of their visits, and if months and days are not specified,
cannot learn more than the year to which a visit belongs.
Where, for whatever reason, I can only assign a performance to
its accounting year, I generally give it under the calendar
year in which the account ends. This, in the case of a London
company and of a Michaelmas year (much the commonest year for
municipal accounts), is pretty safe, as the touring season was
roughly July to September. Some accounting years (Coventry,
Marlborough, Stratford-on-Avon) end later still, but if, as at
Bath, the year ends about Midsummer, it is often quite a toss-up
to which of two years an entry belongs. In the case of Leicester
performances before 1603, I have combined the indications of
Michaelmas years in M. Bateson, <i>Leicester Records</i>, vol.
iii, with those of calendar years in W. Kelly, <i>Notices
Illustrative of the Drama</i> (1865), 185, and distinguished
between performances before and after Michaelmas. I hope Kelly
has not misled me, and that he found evidence in the entries for
his dating. After 1603 he is the only source. I do not think
that the amount of error which has crept into the following
chapter from the various causes described is likely to be at all
considerable. I have been as careful as possible and most of
Murray’s own extracting is excellently done. I should, however,
add that the Ipswich dates, as given both here and by Murray,
ii. 287.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> from <i>Hist. MSS.</i> ix. i, 248, are unreliable,
because some of the rolls from which they are taken contain
membranes properly belonging to those for other years; cf. my
notes on Leicester’s (pp. 89, 91), Queen’s (p. 106), Warwick’s
(p. 99), Derby’s (p. 120), King’s (p. 209).]</p>

<h4>A. INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>The present chapter contains detailed chronicles&mdash;too often, I
fear, lapsing into arid annals of performances at Court or in the
provinces&mdash;of all the companies traceable in London during any year
between 1558 and 1616. The household and other establishments to which
the companies were attached are taken as the basis of classification.
This principle is open to criticism. Certainly it has not always the
advantage of presenting economic units. It is improbable that there
was any continuity as regards membership between the bodies of actors
successively appearing, often after long intervals, under the names of
Sussex or Hunsdon or Derby. On the other hand, particular associations
of actors can sometimes be discerned as holding together under a change
of patrons. Thus between 1571 and 1583 Laurence and John Dutton seem to
have led a single company, which earned the nickname of the Chameleons,
first in the service of Sir Robert Lane and then, turn by turn, in that
of the Earls of Lincoln, Warwick, and Oxford. The real successors,
again, of the Derby’s men of 1593 are less the Derby’s men of 1595–1618
than the Hunsdon’s men of 1594–1603, who in course of time became the
King’s men without any breach of their unity as a trading association.
Nevertheless, an arrangement under patrons is a practicable one, since
companies nearly always appear under the names of their patrons in
official documents, while an arrangement under trading associations
is not. Actors are a restless folk, and the history of the Admiral’s
men, or the Queen’s Revels, or the Lady Elizabeth’s men, will show how
constantly their business organizations were disturbed by the coming
and going of individuals, and by the breaking and reconstruction of the
agreements on which they were based. It is but rarely that we have any
clue to these intricacies; and I have therefore followed the households
as the best available guides, indicating breaches of continuity and
affiliations, where these appear to exist, and adopting as far as
possible an order which, without pretence of being scientific, will
bring each household under consideration roughly at the point at
which its servants become of the greatest significance to the general
history of the stage. The method may perhaps be described as that of a
λαμπαδηφορία.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p>A study of the succession of the companies gives rise to a few general
considerations. During the earlier years of Elizabeth’s reign the drama
is under the domination of the boy companies. This may be in part due
to the long-standing humanistic tradition of the Renaissance, although
the lead is in fact taken not so much by schoolboys in the stricter
sense, as by the trained musical establishments of the royal chapels
and still more that of the St. Paul’s choir under Sebastian Westcott.
More important points perhaps are, that the Gentlemen of the Chapel,
who had been prominent under Henry VIII, had ceased to perform, that
the royal Interluders had been allowed to decay, and that the other
professional companies had not yet found a permanent economic basis in
London, while their literary accomplishment was still upon a popular
rather than a courtly level. Whatever the cause or causes, the fact is
undeniable. Out of seventy-eight rewards for Court performances between
1558 and 1576, twenty-one went to the Paul’s boys, fifteen to the royal
chapels, and ten to schoolboys, making a total of forty-six, as against
only thirty-two paid to adult companies. And if the first half of this
period only be taken, the disproportion is still greater, for by 1567
the Paul’s boys had received eleven rewards, other boys two, and the
adult companies six. A complete reversal of this position coincides
rather markedly with the building of the first permanent theatres in
1576. Between 1576 and 1583 the adult companies had thirty-nine rewards
and the boys only seventeen. There is also a rapid growth in the number
of companies. Before 1576 the Earl of Leicester’s men and the Duttons
were alone conspicuous. After 1576 the entertainment of a London
company seems to become a regular practice with those great officers
the Lord Chamberlain and the Lord Admiral, as well as with special
favourites of the Queen, such as the Earl of Leicester himself or the
Earl of Oxford. Stockwood in 1578 speaks of ‘eighte ordinarie places’
in the City as occupied by the players. A Privy Council order of the
same year limits the right to perform to six companies selected to take
part in the Court festivities at Christmas, namely Leicester’s men,
Warwick’s, Sussex’s, Essex’s, and the Children of the Chapel and St.
Paul’s. Gabriel Harvey, writing to Edmund Spenser of the publication of
his virelays in the following summer, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Ye have preiudished my good name for ever in thrustinge me
thus on the stage to make tryall of my extemporall faculty,
and to play Wylsons or Tarletons parte. I suppose thou wilt
go nighe hande shortelye to sende my lorde of Lycesters or my
lorde of Warwickes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> Vawsis, or my lord Ritches players, or sum
other freshe starteupp comedanties unto me for sum newe devised
interlude, or sum maltconceivid comedye fitt for the Theater, or
sum other paintid stage whereat thou and thy lively copesmates
in London maye lawghe ther mouthes and bellyes full for pence or
twoepence apeece.’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Doubtless many of this mushroom brood of ‘freshe starteupp comedanties’
never succeeded in making good their permanent footing in the
metropolis. Lord Vaux’s men, whom Harvey mentions, were never fortunate
enough to be summoned to Court; and the same may be said of Lord
Arundel’s men, Lord Berkeley’s, and Lord Abergavenny’s. Such men, after
their cast for fortune, had to drift away into the provinces, and pad
the hoof on the hard roads once more.</p>

<p>The next septennial period, 1583–90, witnessed the extinction, for
a decade or so, of the boy companies, in spite of the new impulse
given to the latter by the activity as a playwright of John Lyly. Of
forty-five Court payments made during these years, thirty apparently
went to men and only fifteen to boys. This ultimate success of
the professional organizations may largely have been due to their
employment of such university wits as Marlowe, Peele, Greene, Lodge,
and Nashe in the writing of plays, with which Lyly could be challenged
on his own ground before the Court, while a sufficient supply of
chronicle histories and other popular stuff could still be kept on
the boards to tickle the ears of the groundlings. The undisputed
pre-eminence lay during this period with the Queen’s men, who made
within it no less than twenty-one appearances at Court. This company
enjoyed the prestige of the royal livery, transferred to it from the
now defunct Interluders, which had a ready effect in the unloosing of
municipal pockets. And at its foundation in 1583 it incorporated, in
addition to Tarlton, whose origin is unknown, the leading members of
the pre-existing companies: Wilson and Laneham from Leicester’s, Adams
from Sussex’s, and John Dutton from Oxford’s. The former fellows of
these lucky ones were naturally hardly able to maintain their standing.
In January 1587 Leicester’s, Oxford’s, and the Admiral’s were still
setting up their bills side by side with those of the Queen’s.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But
the first two are not heard of at Court again, and even the Admiral’s
were hardly able to make a show except by coalition with other
companies. Thus we find the Admiral’s combining with Hunsdon’s in
1585, and with Strange’s perhaps from 1589 onwards, and it became the
destiny of this last alliance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> under the leadership of Edward Alleyn,
to dispossess the Queen’s men, after the death of Tarlton in 1588, from
their pride of place. The fall of the Queen’s men was sudden. In 1590–1
they gave four Court plays to two by their rivals; in 1591–2 they gave
one, and their rivals six. In their turn they appear to have been
reduced to forming a coalition with Lord Sussex’s men.</p>

<p>The plague-years of 1592–4 brought disaster, chaos, and change
into the theatrical world. Only the briefest London seasons were
possible. The necessities of travelling led to further combinations
and recombinations of groups, one of which may have given rise to
the ephemeral existence of Lord Pembroke’s men. And, by the time the
public health was restored, the Queen’s had reconciled themselves
to a provincial existence, and continued until 1603 to make their
harvest of the royal name, as their predecessors in title had done,
without returning to London at all. The combination of which Alleyn
had been the centre broke up, and its component elements reconstituted
themselves as the two great companies of the Chamberlain’s and the
Admiral’s men. Between these there was a vigorous rivalry, which
sometimes showed itself in lawsuits, sometimes in the more legitimate
form of competing plays on similar themes. Thus a popular sentiment
offended by the Chamberlain’s men in <i>1 Henry IV</i> was at once
appealed to by the Admiral’s with <i>Sir John Oldcastle</i>. And when
the Admiral’s scored a success by their representation of forest life
in <i>Robin Hood</i>, the Chamberlain’s were quickly ready to counter
with <i>As You Like It</i>. I think the Chamberlain’s secured the
better position of the two. They had their Burbadge to pit against the
reputation of Alleyn; they had their honey-tongued Shakespeare; and
they had a business organization which gave them a greater stability
of membership than any company in the hands of Henslowe was likely to
secure. If one may once more use the statistics of Court performances
as a criterion, they are found to have appeared thirty-two times and
their rivals only twenty times from 1594 to 1603. Between them the
Chamberlain’s and the Admiral’s enjoyed for some years a practical
monopoly of the London stage, which received an official recognition by
the action of the Privy Council in 1597. But this state of things did
not long continue. Ambitious companies, such as Pembroke’s, disregarded
the directions of the Council. Derby’s men, Worcester’s, Hertford’s,
one by one obtained at least a temporary footing at Court, and in 1602
the influence of the Earl of Oxford was strong enough to bring about
the admission to a permanent home in London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> of a third company made up
of his own and Worcester’s servants. Even more dangerous, perhaps, to
the monopoly was the revival of the boy companies, Paul’s in 1599 and
the Chapel in 1600. The imps not only took by their novelty in the eyes
of a younger generation of play-goers. They began a warfare of satire,
in which they ‘berattled the common stages’ with a vigour and dexterity
that betray the malice of the poets against the players which had been
a motive in their rehabilitation.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>No material change took place at the coming of James. The three adult
companies, the Chamberlain’s, the Admiral’s, Worcester’s, passed
respectively under the patronage of James, Prince Henry, and Queen
Anne.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On the death of Prince Henry in 1612 his place was taken
by the Elector Palatine. The Children of the Chapel also received
the patronage of Queen Anne, as Children of the Queen’s Revels. The
competition for popular favour continued severe. Dekker refers to it in
1608 and the preacher Crashaw in 1610.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is to be noticed, however,
that Dekker speaks only of ‘a deadly war’ between ‘three houses’,
presumably regarding the boy companies as negligible. And in fact
these companies were on the wane. By 1609 the Queen’s Revels, though
still in existence, had suffered from the wearing off of novelty,
from the tendency of boys to grow older, from the plague-seasons of
1603–4 and 1608–9, which they were less well equipped than the better
financed adults to withstand, from the indiscretions and quarrels of
their managers, and from the loss of the Blackfriars, of which the
King’s men had secured possession.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The Paul’s boys had been bought
off by the payment of a ‘dead rent’ or blackmail to the Master. A
third company, the King’s Revels, had been started, but had failed to
establish itself.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The three houses were not, indeed, left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> with
an undisputed field. Advantage was taken of the predilection of the
younger members of the royal family for the drama, and patents were
obtained, in 1610 for a Duke of York’s company, and in 1611 for a Lady
Elizabeth’s company. These also had but a frail life. In 1613 the
Lady Elizabeth’s and the Queen’s Revels coalesced under the dangerous
wardenship of Henslowe. In 1615 the Duke of York’s, now Prince
Charles’s, men joined the combination. And finally in 1616 the Prince’s
men were left alone to make up the tale of four London companies,
and the Lady Elizabeth’s and the Queen’s Revels disappeared into the
provinces. The list of men summoned before the Privy Council in March
1615 to account for playing in Lent contains the names of the leaders
of the four companies, the King’s, the Queen’s, the Palsgrave’s, and
the Prince’s. The King’s played at the Globe and Blackfriars, the
Queen’s at the Red Bull, whence they moved in 1617 to the Cockpit, the
Palsgrave’s at the Fortune, and the Prince’s at the Hope. The supremacy
of the King’s men during 1603–16 was undisputed. Of two hundred and
ninety-nine plays rewarded at Court for that period, they gave one
hundred and seventy-seven, the Prince’s men forty-seven, the Queen’s
men twenty-eight, the Duke of York’s men twenty, the Lady Elizabeth’s
men nine, the Queen’s Revels boys fifteen, and the Paul’s boys three.
Their plays, moreover, were those usually selected for performance
before James himself. It is possible, however, that the Red Bull and
the Fortune were better able to hold their own against the Globe when
it came to attracting a popular audience.</p>

early history of the two cathedral schools, often confused, are
printed and discussed by A. F. Leach in <i>St. Paul’s School
before Colet</i> (<i>Archaeologia</i>, lxii. 1. 191) and in
<i>Journal of Education</i> (1909), 503. M. F. J. McDonnell,
<i>A History of St. Paul’s School</i> (1909), carries on the
narrative of the grammar school. The official chroniclers of
the cathedral, perhaps owing to the loss of archives in the
Great Fire, have given no connected account of the choir school;
with the material available on the dramatic side they appear
to be unfamiliar. Valuable contributions are W. H. G. Flood,
<i>Master Sebastian</i>, in <i>Musical Antiquary</i>, iii. 149;
iv. 187; and H. N. Hillebrand, <i>Sebastian Westcote, Dramatist
and Master of the Children of Paul’s</i> (1915, <i>J. G. P.</i>

the Children of Paul’s and Music in St. Paul’s Cathedral</i>

101, 155, by J. S. Bumpus, <i>The Organists and Composers of St.

St. Paul’s Cathedral</i> (1909).]</p>

<p>Mr. Leach has succeeded in tracing the grammar school, as part of
the establishment of St. Paul’s Cathedral, to the beginning of the
twelfth century. It was then located in the south-east corner of the
churchyard, near the bell-tower, and here it remained to 1512, when it
was rebuilt, endowed, and reorganized on humanist lines by Dean Colet,
and thereafter to 1876, when it was transferred to Horsham in Sussex.
Originally the master was one of the canons; but by the beginning
of the thirteenth century this officer had taken on the name of
chancellor, and the general supervision of the actual schoolmaster, a
vicar choral, was only one of his functions. Distinct from the grammar
school was the choir school, for which the responsible dignitary was
not the chancellor, but the precentor, in whose hands the appointment
of a master of the song school rested.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> There was, however, a third
branch of the cathedral organization also concerned with the training
of boys. The almonry or hospital, maintained by the chapter for the
relief of the poor, seems to have been established at the end of the
twelfth century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> and statutes of about the same date make it the duty
of a canon residentiary to assist in the maintenance of its <i>pueri
elemosinarii</i>, and prescribe the special services to be rendered
them at their great annual ceremony of the Boy Bishop on Innocents’
Day.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In the thirteenth century the supervision of these boys was in
the hands of another subordinate official, appointed by the chapter and
known as the almoner. The number of the boys was then eight; it was
afterwards increased, apparently in 1358, to ten.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The almoner is
required to provide for their literary and moral education, and their
liturgical duties are defined as consisting of standing in pairs at the
corners of the choir and carrying candles.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> A later version of the
statutes provides for their musical education, and it is clear that
these <i>pueri elemosinarii</i> were in fact identical with or formed
the nucleus of the boys of the song school.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> During the sixteenth
century the posts of almoner and master of the song school, although
technically distinct, were in practice held together, and the holder
was ordinarily a member of the supplementary cathedral establishment
known as the College of Minor Canons.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> To this college had been
appropriated the parish church of St. Gregory, on the south side of St.
Paul’s, just west of the Chapter or Convocation House, and here the
song school was already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> housed by the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The college
had also a common hall on the north of the cathedral, near the Pardon
churchyard; and hard by was the almonry in Paternoster Row.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
statutes left the almoner the option of either giving the boys their
literary education himself, or sending them elsewhere. It naturally
proved convenient to send them to the grammar school, and the almoners
claimed that they had a right to admission without fees.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> On the
other side we find the grammar school boys directed by Colet to attend
the Boy Bishop ceremony and make their offerings.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Evidently there
was much give and take between song school and grammar school.</p>

<p>As early as 1378 the scholars of Paul’s are said to have prepared a
play of the History of the Old Testament for public representation
at Christmas.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Whether they took a share in the other miracles
recorded in mediaeval London, it is impossible to say. A century and
a half later the boys of the grammar school, during the mastership
of John Ritwise, are found contributing interludes, in the humanist
fashion, to the entertainment of the Court. On 10 November 1527 they
gave an anti-Lutheran play in Latin and French before the King and the
ambassadors of Francis I, and in the following year the <i>Phormio</i>
before Wolsey, who also saw them, if Anthony Wood can be trusted, in
a <i>Dido</i> written by Ritwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> himself.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> There is no evidence
that Ritwise’s successors followed his example by bringing their
pupils to Court; and the next performances by Paul’s boys, which can
be definitely traced, began a quarter of a century later, and were
under the control of Sebastian Westcott, master of the song school,
and were therefore presumably given by boys of that school. Westcott
in 1545 was a Yeoman of the Chamber at Court.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He was ‘scolemaister
of Powles’ by New Year’s Day 1557, when he presented a manuscript
book of ditties to Queen Mary.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Five years earlier, he had brought
children to Hatfield, to give a play before the Princess Elizabeth; and
the chances are that these were the Paul’s boys.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> With him came one
Heywood, who may fairly be identified with John Heywood the dramatist;
and this enables us, more conjecturally, to reduce a little further the
gap in the dramatic history of the Paul’s choir, for some years before,
in March 1538, Heywood had already received a reward for playing an
interlude with ‘his children’ before the Lady Mary.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> There is
nothing beyond this phrase to suggest that Heywood had a company of
his own, and it is not probable that he was ever himself master of
the choir school.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But he may very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> well have supplied them with
plays, both in Westcott’s time and also in that of his predecessor John
Redford. Several of Heywood’s verses are preserved in a manuscript,
which also contains Redford’s <i>Wyt and Science</i> and fragments of
other interludes, not improbably intended for performance by the boys
under his charge.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> A play ‘of childerne sett owte by Mr. Haywood’ at
Court during the spring of 1553 may also belong to the Paul’s boys.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Certain performances ascribed to them at Hatfield, during the Princess
Elizabeth’s residence there in her sister’s reign, have of late fallen
under suspicion of being apocryphal.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>From the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign Westcott’s theatrical
enterprise stands out clearly enough. On 7 August 1559 the Queen was
entertained by the Earl of Arundel at Nonsuch with ‘a play of the
chylderyn of Powlles and ther Master Se[bastian], Master Phelypes,
and Master Haywod’.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> If ‘Master Phelypes’ was the John Philip or
Phillips who wrote <i>Patient Grissell</i> (<i>c.</i> 1566), this play
may also belong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> to the Paul’s repertory. Heywood could not adapt
himself again to a Protestant England, and soon left the country.
Sebastian Westcott was more fortunate. In 1560 he was appointed as Head
of the College of Minor Canons or Sub-dean.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Shortly afterwards,
being unable to accept the religious settlement, he was sentenced
to deprivation of his offices, which included that of organist, but
escaped through the personal influence of Elizabeth, in spite of
some searchings of the heart of Bishop Grindal as to his suitability
to be an instructor of youth.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In fact he succeeded in remaining
songmaster of Paul’s for the next twenty-three years, and during that
period brought his boys to Court no less than twenty-seven times,
furnishing a far larger share of the royal Christmas entertainment,
especially during the first decade of the reign, than any other single
company. The chronicle of his plays must now be given. There was one
at each of the Christmases of 1560–1 and 1561–2, one between 6 January
and 9 March 1562, and one at the Christmas of 1562–3.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> During the
next winter the plague stopped London plays. At the Christmas of
1564–5 there were two by the Paul’s boys, of which the second fell on
2 January, and at that of 1565–6 three, two at Court and one at the
Lady Cecilia’s lodging in the Savoy. There were two again at each of
the Christmases of 1566–7 and 1567–8, and one on 1 January 1569. During
the winter of 1569–70 the company was, exceptionally, absent from
Court. They reappeared on 28 December 1570, and again at Shrovetide
(25–7 February) 1571. On 28 December 1571 they gave the ‘tragedy’ of
<i>Iphigenia</i>, which Professor Wallace identifies with the comedy
called <i>The Bugbears</i>, but which might, for the matter of that, be
Lady Lumley’s translation from the Greek of Euripides. At the Christmas
of 1572–3 they played before 7 January.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> On 27 December 1573 they gave
<i>Alcmaeon</i>. They played on 2 February 1575, and a misfortune which
befell them in the same year is recorded in a letter of 3 December from
the Privy Council, which sets out that ‘one of Sebastianes boyes, being
one of his principall plaiers, is lately stolen and conveyed from him’,
and instructs no less personages than the Master of the Rolls and Dr.
Wilson, one of the Masters of Requests, to examine the persons whom he
suspected and proceed according to law with them.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Five days later
the Court of Aldermen drew up a protest against Westcott’s continued
Romish tendencies.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The next Court performance by the boys was on
6 January 1576. On 1 January 1577 they gave <i>Error</i>, and on 19
February <i>Titus and Gisippus</i>. They played on 29 December 1577,
and one wonders whether it was anything amiss with that performance
which led to an entry in the Acts of the Privy Council for the same
day that ‘Sebastian was committid to the Marshalsea’.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Whether
this was so or not, the Paul’s boys were included in the list of
companies authorized to practise publicly in the City for the following
Christmas. On 1 January 1579 they gave <i>The Marriage of Mind and
Measure</i>, on 3 January 1580 <i>Scipio Africanus</i>, and on 6
January 1581 <i>Pompey</i>. A play on 26 December 1581 is anonymous,
but may possibly be the <i>Cupid and Psyche</i> mentioned as ‘plaid at
Paules’ in Gosson’s <i>Playes Confuted</i> of 1582.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In the course of 1582 Sebastian Westcott died, and this event led to
an important development in the dramatic activities of the boys.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Hitherto their performances, when not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> at Court, had been in their own
quarters ‘at Paules’, although the notice of 1578, as well as Gosson’s
reference, suggests that the public were not altogether excluded from
their rehearsals. Probably they used their singing school, which
may have been still, as in the twelfth century, the church of St.
Gregory itself.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This privacy, even if something of a convention,
had perhaps enabled them to utilize the services of the grammar
school when they had occasion to make a display of erudition.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
After Westcott’s death, however, they appear to have followed the
example of the Chapel, who had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> in 1576 taken a step in the
direction of professionalism, by transferring their performances
to Farrant’s newly opened theatre at the Blackfriars. Here, if the
rather difficult evidence can be trusted, the Paul’s boys appear to
have joined them, and to have formed part of a composite company, to
which Lord Oxford’s boys also contributed, and which produced the
<i>Campaspe</i> and <i>Sapho and Phao</i> of the earl’s follower John
Lyly. Lyly took these plays to Court on 1 January and 3 March 1584,
and Henry Evans, who was also associated with the enterprise, took a
play called <i>Agamemnon and Ulysses</i> on 27 December. On all three
occasions the official patron of the company was the Earl of Oxford.
In <i>Agamemnon and Ulysses</i> it must be doubtful whether the Paul’s
boys had any share, for in the spring of 1584 the Blackfriars theatre
ceased to be available, and the combination probably broke up.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
This, however, was far from being the end of Lyly’s connexion with
the boys, for the title-pages of no less than five of his later plays
acknowledge them as the presenters. They had, indeed, a four years’
period of renewed activity at Court, under the mastership of Thomas
Giles, who, being already almoner, became Master of the Song School on
22 May 1584, and in the following year received a royal commission to
‘take up’ boys for the choir, analogous to that ordinarily granted to
masters of the Chapel Children.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> There is no specific mention of
plays in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> the document, but its whole basis is in the service which
the boys may be called upon to do the Queen in music and singing.
Under Giles the company appeared at Court nine times during four
winter seasons; on 26 February 1587, on 1 January and 2 February
1588, on 27 December 1588, 1 January and 12 January 1589, and on
28 December 1589, 1 January and 6 January 1590. The title-pages of
Lyly’s <i>Endymion</i>, <i>Galathea</i>, and <i>Midas</i> assign the
representation of these plays at Court to a 2 February, a 1 January,
and a 6 January respectively. <i>Endymion</i> must therefore belong to
1588 and <i>Midas</i> to 1590; for <i>Galathea</i> the most probable
of the three years is 1588. <i>Mother Bombie</i> and <i>Love’s
Metamorphosis</i> can be less precisely dated, but doubtless belong
to the period 1587–90. At some time or other, and probably before
1590, the Paul’s boys performed a play of <i>Meleager</i>, of which an
abstract only, without author’s name, is preserved. It is not, I think,
to be supposed that Lyly, although he happened to be a grandson of the
first High Master of Colet’s school, had any official connexion either
with that establishment or with the choir school. It is true that
Gabriel Harvey says of him in 1589, ‘He hath not played the Vicemaster
of Poules and the Foolemaster of the Theatre for naughtes’.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But
this is merely Harvey’s jesting on the old dramatic sense of the term
‘vice’, and the probabilities are that Lyly’s relation as dramatist
to Giles as responsible manager of the company was much that which
had formerly existed between John Heywood and Sebastian Westcott.
Nevertheless, it was this connexion which ultimately brought the Paul’s
plays to a standstill. Lyly was one of the literary men employed about
1589 to answer the Martin Marprelate pamphleteers in their own vein,
and to this end he availed himself of the Paul’s stage, apparently
with the result that, when it suited the government to disavow its
instruments, that stage was incontinently suppressed.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The reason
may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> be conjectural, but the fact is undoubted. The Paul’s boys
disappear from the Court records after 1590. In 1591 the printer of
<i>Endymion</i> writes in his preface that ‘Since the Plaies in Paules
were dissolved, there are certaine Commedies come to my handes by
chaunce’, and the prolongation of this dissolution is witnessed to in
1596 by Thomas Nashe, who in his chaff of Gabriel Harvey’s anticipated
practice in the Arches says, ‘Then we neede neuer wish the Playes at
Powles vp againe, but if we were wearie with walking, and loth to goe
too farre to seeke sport, into the Arches we might step, and heare
him plead; which would bee a merrier Comedie than euer was old Mother
<i>Bomby</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>A last theatrical period opened for the boys with the appointment about
1600 of a new master. This was one Edward Pearce or Piers, who had
become a Gentleman of the Chapel on 16 March 1589, and by 15 August
1600, when his successor was sworn in, had ‘yealded up his place for
the Mastership of the children of Poules’.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> I am tempted to believe
that in reviving the plays Pearce had the encouragement of Richard
Mulcaster, who had become High Master of the grammar school in 1596,
and during his earlier mastership of Merchant Taylors had on several
occasions brought his boys to Court. Pearce is first found in the
Treasurer of the Chamber’s Accounts as payee for a performance on 1
January 1601, but several of the extant plays produced during this
section of the company’s career are of earlier date, and one of them,
Marston’s <i><span class="allsmcap">I</span> Antonio and Mellida</i>, can hardly be later
than 1599. A stage direction of this play apparently records the names
of two of the performers as Cole and Norwood.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The Paul’s boys,
therefore, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> ‘up again’ before their rivals of the Chapel, who
cannot be shown to have begun in the Blackfriars under Henry Evans
until 1600.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> This being so, they were probably also responsible
for Marston’s revision in 1599 of <i>Histriomastix,</i> which by
giving offence to Ben Jonson, led him to satire Marston’s style in
<i>Every Man Out of His Humour</i>, and so introduced the ‘war of
the theatres’.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Before the end of 1600 they had probably added to
their repertory Chapman’s <i>Bussy d’Ambois</i>, and certainly <i>The
Maid’s Metamorphosis</i>, <i>The Wisdom of Dr. Dodipoll</i>, and
<i>Jack Drum’s Entertainment</i>, all three of which were entered on
the Stationers’ Register, and the first two printed, during that year.
<i>Jack Drum’s Entertainment</i> followed in 1601 and contains the
following interesting passage of autobiography:<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The criticism, being a self-criticism, must not be taken too seriously.
So far as published plays are concerned, <i>Histriomastix</i> is the
only one to which it applies. In Marston, Chapman, and Middleton the
company had enlisted vigorous young playwrights, who were probably not
sorry to be free from the yoke of the professional actors, and appear
to have followed the exceptional policy of printing some at least of
their new plays as soon as they were produced.</p>

<p>On 11 March 1601, two months after the boys made their first bow at
Court, the Lord Mayor was ordered by the Privy Council to suppress
plays ‘at Powles’ during Lent. It is to be inferred that they were,
as of old, acting in their singing school. Confirmation is provided
by a curious note appended by William Percy to his manuscript volume
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> plays, presumably in sending them to be considered with a view to
production by the boys. The plays bear dates in 1601–3, but it can
hardly be taken for granted that they were in fact produced by the
Paul’s or any other company. The note runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">A note to the Master of Children of Powles.</p>

<p>Memorandum, that if any of the fine and formost of these
Pastorals and Comoedyes conteyned in this volume shall but
overeach in length (the children not to begin before foure,
after prayers, and the gates of Powles shutting at six) the
tyme of supper, that then in tyme and place convenient, you do
let passe some of the songs, and make the consort the shorter;
for I suppose these plaies be somewhat too long for that place.
Howsoever, on your own experience, and at your best direction,
be it. Farewell to you all.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Both parts of Marston’s <i>Antonio and Mellida</i> were entered on
the Stationers’ Register in the autumn of 1601 and printed in 1602.
The second part may have been on the stage during 1601, and in the
same year the boys probably produced John Marston’s <i>What You
Will</i>, and certainly played ‘privately’, as the Chamberlain’s men
did ‘publicly’, <i>Satiromastix</i> in which Dekker, with a hand from
Marston, brought his swashing blow against the redoubtable Jonson. This
also was registered in 1601 and printed in 1602. There is no sign of
the boys at Court in the winter of 1601–2. In the course of 1602 their
play of <i>Blurt Master Constable</i>, by Middleton, was registered
and printed. They were at Court on 1 January 1603, for the last time
before Elizabeth, and on 20 February 1604, for the first time before
James. Either the choir school or the grammar school boys took part in
the pageant speeches at the coronation triumph on 15 March 1604.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
To the year 1604 probably belongs <i>Westward Ho!</i> which introduced
to the company, in collaboration with Dekker, a new writer, John
Webster. <i>Northward Ho!</i> by the same authors, followed in 1605.
The company was not at Court for the winter of 1604–5, but during that
of 1605–6 they gave two plays before the Princes Henry and Charles. For
these the payee was not Pearce, but Edward Kirkham, who is described
in the Treasurer of the Chamber’s account as ‘one of the Mr<sup>es</sup> of
the Childeren of Pawles’. Kirkham, who was Yeoman of the Revels, had
until recently been a manager of the Children of the Revels at the
Blackfriars. It may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> have been the disgrace brought upon these by
<i>Eastward Ho!</i> in the course of 1605 that led him to transfer his
activities elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> With him he seems to have brought Marston’s
<i>The Fawn</i>, probably written in 1604 and ascribed in the first of
the two editions of 1606 to the Queen’s Revels alone, in the second to
them ‘and since at Poules’. The charms of partnership with Kirkham were
not, however, sufficient to induce Pearce to continue his enterprise.
The last traceable appearance of the Paul’s boys was on 30 July 1606,
when they gave <i>The Abuses</i> before James and King Christian of
Denmark.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Probably the plays were discontinued not long afterwards.
This would account for the large number of play-books belonging to
the company which reached the hands of the publishers in 1607 and
1608. The earlier policy of giving plays to the press immediately
after production does not seem to have endured beyond 1602. Those now
printed, in addition to <i>Bussy D’Ambois</i>, <i>What You Will</i>,
<i>Westward Ho!</i> and <i>Northward Ho!</i> already mentioned,
included Middleton’s <i>Michaelmas Term</i>, <i>The Phoenix</i>, <i>A
Mad World, my Masters</i>, and <i>A Trick to Catch the Old One</i>,
together with <i>The Puritan</i>, very likely also by Middleton, and
<i>The Woman Hater</i>, the first work of Francis Beaumont. <i>The
Puritan</i> can be dated, from a chronological allusion, in 1606. The
title-pages of <i>The Woman Hater</i>, <i>A Mad World, my Masters</i>,
and <i>A Trick to Catch the Old One</i> specify them to have been
‘lately’ acted. It is apparent from the second quarto of <i>A Trick to
Catch the Old One</i> that the Children of the Blackfriars took it over
and presented it at Court on 1 January 1609. This was probably part of
a bargain as to which we have another record. Pearce may have had at
the back of his mind a notion of reopening his theatre some day. But
it is given in evidence in the lawsuit of <i>Keysar v. Burbadge</i>
in 1610 that, while it was still closed, he was approached on behalf
of the other ‘private’ houses in London, those of the Blackfriars
and the Whitefriars, and offered a ‘dead rent’ of £20 a year, ‘that
there might be a cessation of playeinge and playes to be acted in the
said howse neere S<sup>t</sup>. Paules Church’.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This must have been in the
winter of 1608–9, just as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> Revels company was migrating from the
Blackfriars to the Whitefriars. The agent was Philip Rosseter who, with
Robert Keysar, was financially interested in the Revels company. When
the King’s men began to occupy the Blackfriars in the autumn of 1609,
they took on responsibility for half the dead rent, but whether the
arrangement survived the lawsuit of 1610 is unknown.</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;Official records of the Chapel
are to be found in E. F. Rimbault, <i>The Old Cheque Book of
the Chapel Royal</i> (1872, <i>Camden Soc.</i>). Most of the
material for the sixteenth-century part of the present section
was collected before the publication of C. W. Wallace, <i>The
Evolution of the English Drama up to Shakespeare</i> (1912,
cited as Wallace, i), which has, however, been valuable for
purposes of revision. J. M. Manly, <i>The Children of the Chapel
Royal and their Masters</i> (1910, <i>C. H.</i> vi. 279), W.
H. Flood, <i>Queen Mary’s Chapel Royal</i> (<i>E. H. R.</i>
xxxiii. 83), H. M. Hildebrand, <i>The Early History of the
Chapel Royal</i> (1920, <i>M. P.</i> xviii. 233), are useful
contributions. The chief published sources for the seventeenth
century are three lawsuits discovered by J. Greenstreet and
printed in full by F. G. Fleay, <i>A Chronicle History of the
London Stage</i> (1890), 127, 210, 223. These are (a) <i>Clifton
v. Robinson and Others</i> (Star Chamber, 1601), (b) <i>Evans
v. Kirkham</i> (Chancery, May–June 1612), cited as <i>E. v.
K.</i>, with Fleay’s pages, and (c) <i>Kirkham v. Painton and
Others</i> (Chancery, July–Nov. 1612), cited as <i>K. v. P.</i>
Not much beyond dubious hypothesis is added by C. W. Wallace,
<i>The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars</i> (1908, cited
as Wallace, ii). But Professor Wallace published an additional
suit of importance, (d) <i>Keysar v. Burbadge and Others</i>
(Court of Requests, Feb.–June 1610), in <i>Nebraska University
Studies</i> (1910), x. 336, cited as <i>K. v. B.</i> This is
apparently one of twelve suits other than Greenstreet’s, which
he claims (ii. 36) to have found, with other material, which
may alter the story. In the meantime, I see no reason to depart
from the main outlines sketched in my article on <i>Court
Performances under James the First</i> (1909, <i>M. L. R.</i>
iv. 153).]</p>

<p class="p-left">The Chapel was an ancient part of the establishment of the Household,
traceable far back into the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Up to the end of
the fourteenth, we hear only of chaplains and clerks. These were
respectively priests and laymen, and the principal chaplain came to
bear the title of Dean.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Children of the Chapel first appear under
Henry IV, who appointed a chaplain to act as Master of Grammar for them
in 1401.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In 1420 comes the first of a series of royal commissions
authorizing the impressment of boys for the Chapel service, and in
1444 the first appointment of a Master of the Children, John Plummer,
by patent.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It is probably to the known tastes of Henry VI that the
high level of musical accomplishment, which had been reached by the
singers of the Chapel during the next reign was due.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The status
and duties of the Chapel are set out with full detail in the <i>Liber
Niger</i> about 1478, at which date the establishment consisted of a
Dean, six Chaplains, twenty Clerks, two Yeomen or Epistolers, and eight
Children. These were instructed by a Master of Song, chosen by the Dean
from ‘the seyd felyshipp of Chapell’, and a Master of Grammar, whose
services were also available for the royal Henchmen.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> There is no
further record of the Master of Grammar; but with this exception the
establishment continued to exist on much the same footing, apart from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
some increase of numbers, up to the seventeenth century.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Although
subject to some general supervision from the Lord Chamberlain and
to that extent part of the Chamber, it was largely a self-contained
organization under its own Dean. Elizabeth, however, left the post
of Dean vacant, and the responsibility of the Lord Chamberlain then
became more direct.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> It probably did not follow, at any rate in
its full numbers, a progress, but moved with the Court to the larger
‘standing houses’, except possibly to Windsor where there was a
separate musical establishment in St. George’s Chapel.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It does
not seem, at any rate in Tudor times, to have had any relation to the
collegiate chapel of St. Stephen in the old palace of Westminster.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
The number of Children varied between eight and ten up to 1526, when
it was finally fixed by Henry VIII at twelve.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The chaplains and
clerks were collectively known in the sixteenth century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> as the
Gentlemen of the Chapel, and the most important of them, next to one
who acted as subdean, was the Master of the Children, who trained
them in music and, as time went on, also formed them into a dramatic
company. The Master generally held office under a patent during
pleasure, and was entitled in addition to his fee of 7½<i>d.</i> a day
or £91 8<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i> a year as Gentleman and his share in
the general ‘rewards’ of the Chapel, to a special Exchequer annuity
of 40 marks (£26 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>), raised in 1526 to £40,
‘pro exhibicione puerorum’, which is further defined in 1510 as ‘pro
exhibicione vesturarum et lectorum’ and in 1523 as ‘pro sustencione
et diettes’.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> To this, moreover, several other payments came to be
added in the course of Henry VIII’s reign. Originally the Chapel dined
and supped in the royal hall; but this proved inconvenient, and a money
allowance from the Cofferer of the Household was substituted, which was
fixed in 1544 at 1<i>s.</i> a day for each Gentleman and 2<i>s.</i> a
week for each Child.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The allowance for the Children was afterwards
raised to 6<i>d.</i> a day.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Long before this, however, the Masters
had succeeded in obtaining an exceptional allowance of 8<i>d.</i> a
week for the breakfast of each Child, which was reckoned as making £16
a year and paid them in monthly instalments of 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
by the Treasurer of the Chamber. The costs of the Masters in their
journeys for the impressment of Children were also recouped by the
Treasurer of the Chamber. And from him they also received rewards of
20<i>s.</i> when <i>Audivi vocem</i> was sung on All Saints’ Day, £6
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the Children’s feast of St. Nicholas on 6
December, and 40<i>s.</i> when <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i> was sung on
Christmas and St. John’s Days. These were, of course, over and above
any special rewards received for dramatic performances.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In the
provision of <i>vesturae</i> the Masters were helped by the issue
from the Great Wardrobe of black and tawny camlet gowns, yellow satin
coats, and Milan bonnets, which presumably constituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> the festal
and penitential arrays of the choir.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The boys themselves do not
appear to have received any wages but, when their voices had broken,
the King made provision for them at the University or otherwise, and
until this could be done, the Treasurer of the Chamber sometimes paid
allowances to the Master or some other Gentleman for their maintenance
and instruction.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The earlier Masters were John Plummer (1444–55), Henry Abyngdon
(1455–78), Gilbert Banaster (1478–83?), probably John Melyonek
(1483–5), Lawrence Squier (1486–93), and William Newark
(1493–1509).<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Some of these have left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> a musical or literary
reputation, and Banaster is said to have written an interlude in
1482.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But until the end of this period only occasional traces of
dramatic performances by the Chapel can be discerned. An alleged play
by the Gentlemen at the Christmas of 1485 cannot be verified.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The
first recorded performance, therefore, is one of the disguisings at the
wedding of Prince Arthur and Katharine of Spain in 1501, in which two
of the children were concealed in mermaids ‘singing right sweetly and
with quaint hermony’.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of Henry VII’s reign begins a short series of plays
given at the rate of one or two a year by the Gentlemen, which lasted
through 1506–12.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Thereafter there is no other play by the Gentlemen
as such upon record until the Christmas of 1553, when they performed
a morality of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> the principal character was Genus Humanum.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
This had been originally planned for the coronation on the previous 1
October, and as a warrant then issued states that a coronation play
had customarily been given ‘by the gentlemen of the chappell of our
progenitoures’, it may perhaps be inferred that Edward VI’s coronation
play of ‘the story of Orpheus’ on 22 February 1547 was also by the
Gentlemen.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In the meantime the regular series of Chapel plays at
Court had been broken after 1512, and when it was taken up again in
1517 it was not by the Gentlemen, but by the Children.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This is,
of course, characteristic of the Renaissance.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> But an immediate
cause is probably to be found in the personality of William Cornish, a
talented and energetic Master of the Children, who succeeded William
Newark in the autumn of 1509, and held office until his death in
1523.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Cornish appears to have come of a musical family.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> He took
part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> in a play given by the Gentlemen of the Chapel shortly before
his appointment as Master. And although it was some years before he
organized the Children into a definite company, he was the ruling
spirit and chief organizer of the elaborate disguisings which glorified
the youthful court of Henry VIII from the Shrovetide of 1511 to the
visit of the Emperor Charles V in 1522, and hold an important place in
the story, elsewhere dealt with, of the Court mask.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> In these revels
both the Gentlemen and the Children of the Chapel, as well as the King
and his lords and ladies took a part, and they were often designed so
as to frame an interlude, which would call for the services of skilled
performers.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>In view of Cornish’s importance in the history of the stage at
Court, it is matter for regret that none of his dramatic writing
has been preserved, for it is impossible to attach any value to the
fantastic attributions of Professor Wallace, who credits him not only
with the anonymous <i>Calisto and Meliboea</i>, <i>Of Gentleness
and Nobility</i>, <i>The Pardoner and the Frere</i>, and <i>Johan
Johan</i>, but also with <i>The Four Elements</i> and <i>The Four P.
P.</i>, for the authorship of which by John Rastell and John Heywood
respectively there is good contemporary evidence.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> Cornish was
succeeded as Master of the Children by William Crane (1523–45) and
Crane by Richard Bower, whose patent was successively renewed by Edward
VI, presumably by Mary, and finally by Elizabeth on 30 April 1559.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
His service was almost certainly continuous, and it is therefore
rather puzzling to be told that a commission to take up singing
children for the Chapel, similar to that of John Melyonek in 1484,
was issued in February 1550 to Philip van Wilder, a Gentleman of the
Privy Chamber.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Neither the full text nor a reference to the source
for the warrant is given, and I suspect the explanation to be that it
was not for the Chapel at all. Philip van Wilder was a lutenist, one
of a family of musicians of whom others were in the royal service,
and he may not improbably have had a commission to recruit a body of
young minstrels with whom other notices suggest that he may have been
connected.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Bower himself had a commission for the Chapel on 6 June
1552.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Although the Children continued to give performances at Court
both under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> Crane and under Bower, it may be doubted whether they
were quite so prominent as they had been in Cornish’s time. Certainly
they had to contend with the competition of the Paul’s boys. Crane
himself is not known to have been a dramatist. It has been suggested
that Bower’s authorship is indicated by the initials R. B. on the
title-page of <i>Apius and Virginia</i> (1575), but, in view of the
date of the publication, this must be regarded as very doubtful. The
chief Marian producer of plays was Nicholas Udall, but it remains
uncertain whether he wrote for the Chapel Children. Professor Wallace
has no justification whatever for his confident assertions that John
Heywood ‘not only could but did’ write plays for the Chapel, that he
‘had grown up in the Chapel under Cornish’, and that ‘as dramatist and
Court-entertainer’ he ‘was naturally associated with the performances
of the Chapel’.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> There is no proof whatever that Heywood began as a
Chapel boy, and although he certainly wrote plays for boys, they are
nowhere said or implied to have been of the Chapel company. There are
scraps of evidence which indicate that they may have been the Paul’s
boys.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It is also conceivable that they may have been Philip van
Wilder’s young minstrels.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth came to the throne, then, the Chapel had already a
considerable dramatic tradition behind it. But for a decade its share
in the Court revels remains somewhat obscure. The Treasurer of the
Chamber records no payments for performances to its Masters before
1568.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> A note in a Revels inventory of 1560 of the employment of
some white sarcenet ‘in ffurnishinge of a pley by the children of
the Chapple’ may apparently refer to any year from 1555 to 1560, and
it is therefore hazardous to identify the Chapel with the anonymous
players of the interlude of 31 December 1559 which contained ‘suche
matter that they wher commondyd to leyff off’.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Bower may of course
have retained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> Catholic sympathies, but he died on 26 July 1561, and
it is difficult to suppose that the high dramatic reputation of his
successor Richard Edwardes was not based upon a greater number of Court
productions than actually stand to his name.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Edwardes had been a
Gentleman of the Chapel from 1556 or earlier. His patent as Master is

<p class="p-left">At Christmas 1564–5 the boys appeared at Court in a tragedy by
Edwardes, which may have been his extant <i>Damon and Pythias</i>.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
On 2 February 1565 and 2 February 1566 they gave performances before
the lawyers at the Candlemas feasts of Lincoln’s Inn.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> There is
nothing to show that the Chapel had any concern with the successful
play of <i>Palamon and Arcite</i>, written and produced by Edwardes for
Elizabeth’s visit to Oxford in September 1566. Edwardes died on the
following 31 October, and on 15 November William Hunnis was appointed
Master of the Children.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> His formal patent of appointment is dated
22 April 1567, and the bill for his commission, which only differs from
that of Edwardes in minor points of detail, on 18 April.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Hunnis
had been a Gentleman at least since about 1553, with an interval of
disgrace under Mary, owing to his participation in Protestant plots.
He was certainly himself a dramatist, but none of his plays are known
to be extant, and a contemporary eulogy speaks of his ‘enterludes’ as
if they dated from an earlier period than that of his Mastership. It
is, however, natural to suppose that he may have had a hand in some at
least of the pieces which his Children produced at Court. The first
of these was a tragedy at Shrovetide 1568. In the following year is
said to have been published a pamphlet entitled <i>The Children of
the Chapel Stript and Whipt</i>, which apparently originated in some
gross offence given by the dramatic activities of the Chapel to the
growing Puritan sentiment. ‘Plaies’, said the writer, ‘will never be
supprest, while her maiesties unfledged minions flaunt it in silkes and
sattens. They had as well be at their Popish service, in the deuils
garments.’ And again, ‘Even in her maiesties chappel do these pretty
upstart youthes profane the Lordes Day by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> lascivious writhing
of their tender limbs, and gorgeous decking of their apparell, in
feigning bawdie fables gathered from the idolatrous heathen poets’. I
should feel more easy in drawing inferences from this, were the book
extant.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> But it seems to indicate either that the controversialist
of 1569 was less careful than his successors to avoid attacks upon
Elizabeth’s private ‘solace’, or that the idea had already occurred to
the Master of turning his rehearsals of Court plays to profit by giving
open performances in the Chapel. That the Court performances themselves
took place in the Chapel is possible, but not very likely; the usual
places for them seem to have been the Hall or the Great Chamber.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
But no doubt they sometimes fell on a Sunday.</p>

<p>The boys played at Court on 6 January 1570 and during Shrovetide 1571.
On 6 January 1572 they gave <i>Narcissus</i>, and on 13 February 1575 a
play with a hunt in it.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> On all these occasions Hunnis was payee.
An obvious error of the clerk of the Privy Council in entering him as
‘John’ Hunnis in connexion with the issue of a warrant for the payment
of 1572 led Chalmers to infer the existence of two Masters of the name
of Hunnis.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> During the progress of 1575 Hunnis contributed shows to
the ‘Princely Pleasures’ of Kenilworth, and very likely utilized the
services of the boys in these.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> And herewith his active conduct
of the Chapel performances appears to have been suspended for some
years. A play of <i>Mutius Scaevola</i>, given jointly at Court by
the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Windsor on 6 January
1577, is the first of a series for which the place of Hunnis as payee
is taken by Richard Farrant. To this series belong unnamed plays on
27 December 1577 and 27 December 1578, <i>Loyalty and Beauty</i> on 2
March 1579, and <i>Alucius</i> on 27 December<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> 1579.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Farrant, who
is known as a musician, had been a Gentleman of the Chapel in 1553,
and had left on 24 April 1564, doubtless to take up the post of Master
of the Children of Windsor, in which capacity he annually presented a
play at Court from 1566–7 to 1575–6.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> But evidently the two offices
were not regarded as incompatible, for on 5 November 1570, while still
holding his Mastership, he was again sworn in as Gentleman of the
Chapel ‘from Winsore’.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> A recent discovery by M. Feuillerat enables
us to see that his taking over of the Chapel Children from Hunnis
in 1576 was part of a somewhat considerable theatrical enterprise.
Stimulated perhaps by the example of Burbadge’s new-built Theatre, he
took a lease of some of the old Priory buildings in the Blackfriars;
and here, either for the first time, or in continuation of a similar
use of the Chapel itself, which had provoked criticism, the Children
appeared under his direction in performances open to the public.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
The ambiguous relation of the Blackfriars precinct to the jurisdiction
of the City Corporation probably explains the inclusion of the Chapel
in the list of companies whose exercises the Privy Council instructed
the City to tolerate on 24 December 1578. It is, I think, pretty clear
that, although Farrant is described as Master of the Chapel Children
by the Treasurer of the Chamber from 1577 to 1580, and by Hunnis
himself in his petition of 1583,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> he was never technically Master,
but merely acted as deputy to Hunnis, probably even to the extent of
taking all the financial risks off his hands. Farrant was paid for
a comedy at Lincoln’s Inn at Candlemas 1580 and is described in the
entry as ‘one of the Queen’s chaplains’.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> On 30 November 1580 he
died and Hunnis then resumed his normal functions.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The Chapel
played at Court on 5 February 1581, 31 December 1581, 27 February
1582, and 26 December<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> 1582. One of these plays may have been Peele’s
<i>Arraignment of Paris</i>; that of 26 December 1582 was <i>A Game of
Cards</i>, possibly the piece which, according to Sir John Harington,
was thought ‘somewhat too plaine’, and was championed at rehearsal by
‘a notable wise counseller’.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> On the first three of these occasions
the Treasurer merely entered a payment to the Master of the Children,
without giving a name, but in the entry for the last play Hunnis is
specified. It is known, moreover, that Hunnis, together with one John
Newman, took a sub-lease of the Blackfriars from Farrant’s widow
on 20 December 1581. They do not seem to have been very successful
financially, for they were irregular in their rent, and neglected their
repairs. It was perhaps trepidation at the competition likely to arise
from the establishment of the Queen’s men in 1583, which led them to
transfer their interest to one Henry Evans, a scrivener of London, from
whom, when Sir William More took steps to protect himself against the
breach of covenant involved in an alienation without his consent, it
was handed on to the Earl of Oxford and ultimately to John Lyly.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
In November 1583, therefore, Hunnis found himself much dissatisfied
with his financial position, and drew up the following memorial,
probably for submission to the Board of Green Cloth of the royal
household:<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The actual request made by Hunnis seems a modest one. He seems to
have thought that for his boys to have the run of their teeth at the
tables of Whitehall would be a better bargain than the board-wages
of 6<i>d.</i> a day. Doubtless he knew their appetites. I do not
think that the Green Cloth met his views, for in the next reign the
6<i>d.</i> was still being paid and was raised to 10<i>d.</i> for the
benefit of Nathaniel Giles.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Possibly Hunnis did get back the £16
a year for breakfasts, which seems to be the fee described by him as
1<i>s.</i> a day, although that in fact works out to £18 5<i>s.</i> a
year, and the £9 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for largess, if that also had
been withdrawn, since these are included in fee lists for 1593 and
1598.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The ‘perticuler ffees’ to which he refers are presumably the
allowances occasionally paid by Henry for the maintenance of boys whose
voices had changed. In any case Hunnis’s personal grievance must have
been fully met by liberal grants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> of Crown lands which were made him
in 1585.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It will be observed that he says nothing of any profits
derived by him from the dramatic activities of the Children; whether
in the form of rewards at Court or in that of admission fees to public
performances. Plays were no part of the official functions of the
Chapel, although it is consistent with the general policy of the reign
towards the London stage to suppose that Elizabeth and her economical
ministers were well enough content that the deficiencies of her Chapel
maintenance should be eked out, and her Christmas ‘solace’ rendered
possible, out of the profits of public exercise. So far, however, as
the Chapel was concerned, this convenient arrangement was, for the
time, nearly at an end. The facts with regard to the boy companies
during 1584 are somewhat complicated. The Treasurer of the Chamber
paid the Master of the Chapel Children, without specifying his name,
for plays on 6 January and 2 February 1584. He also paid John Lyly
for plays by the Earl of Oxford’s ‘servants’ on 1 January and 3 March
1584, and Henry Evans for a play by the Earl of Oxford’s ‘children’
on 27 December 1584. Were this all, one would naturally assume that
Oxford had brought to Court the ‘lads’ who appeared under his name at
Norwich in 1580, and that these formed a company, quite distinct from
the Chapel, of which the Earl entrusted the management either jointly
or successively to Lyly and Evans. Lyly, of course, is known to have
been at one time in the Earl’s service.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> One would then be left to
speculate as to which company played at the Blackfriars during 1584 and
where the other played. But the real puzzle begins when it is realized
that in the same year 1584 two of Lyly’s plays, <i>Campaspe</i> and
<i>Sapho and Phao</i>, were for the first time printed, that these have
prologues ‘at the Blackfriars’, that their title-pages indicate their
performance at Court, not by Oxford’s company, but by the Chapel and
the Paul’s boys, of which latter the Treasurer of the Chamber makes no
mention, and that the title-pages of the two issues of <i>Campaspe</i>
further specify, in the one case Twelfth Night, and in the other,
which is apparently corrected, New Year’s Day, as the precise date of
performance, while that of <i>Sapho and Phao</i> similarly specifies
Shrove Tuesday. But New Year’s Day and Shrove Tuesday of 1584 are the
days which the Treasurer of the Chamber assigns not to the Chapel, but
to Oxford’s company; and even if you accept Professor Feuillerat’s
rather far-fetched assumption that the days referred to in the
title-pages were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> not necessarily those falling in the year of issue,
you will not find a New Year’s Day, or for the matter of that a Twelfth
Night, since the opening of the Blackfriars, which, if a play-day at
all, is not occupied either by some Chapel or Paul’s play of which the
name is known, or by some other company altogether.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The conjecture
seems inevitable that, when he found himself in financial straits and
with the rivalry of the Queen’s men to face in 1583, Hunnis came to
an arrangement with the Paul’s boys, who had recently lost Sebastian
Westcott, on the one hand, and with the Earl of Oxford and his agents
Lyly and Evans on the other, and put the Blackfriars at the disposal
of a combination of boys from all three companies, who appeared
indifferently at Court under the name of the Master or that of the
Earl. In the course of 1584 Sir William More resumed possession of the
Blackfriars. Henry Evans must have made some temporary arrangement to
enable the company to appear at Court during the winter of 1584–5.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
But for a year or two thereafter there were no boys acting in London
until in 1586 an arrangement with Thomas Giles, Westcott’s successor at
St. Paul’s, afforded a new opportunity for Lyly’s pen.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The Chapel had contributed pretty continuously to Court drama for
nearly a century. They now drop out of its story for about seventeen
years.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> In addition to the two plays of Lyly, one other of their
recent pieces, Peele’s <i>Arraignment of Paris</i>, was printed in
1584. Two former Children, Henry Eveseed and John Bull, afterwards
well known as a musician, became Gentlemen on 30 November 1585 and
in January 1586 respectively.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Absence from Court did not entail
an absolute cessation of dramatic activities. Performances by the
Children are recorded at Ipswich and Norwich in 1586–7 and at Leicester
before Michaelmas in 1591. There is, however, little to bear out the
suggestion that the Chapel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> furnished the boys who played at Croydon,
probably in the archbishop’s palace, during the summers of 1592 and
1593, other than the fact that the author of the play produced in
1593, <i>Summer’s Last Will and Testament</i>, was Thomas Nashe, who
was also part author with Marlowe of <i>Dido</i>, one of two plays
printed as Chapel plays in 1594. The extant text of the other play,
<i>The Wars of Cyrus</i>, seems to be datable between 1587 and 1594.
Hunnis died on 6 June 1597, and on 9 June 1597 Nathaniel Giles, ‘being
before extraordinary’, was sworn as a regular Gentleman of the Chapel
and Master of the Children. Giles, like Farrant, came ‘from Winsore’.
Born about 1559, he was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and was
appointed Clerk in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor, and Master of the
Children on 1 October 1595. He earned a considerable reputation as a
musician, and died in possession of both Masterships at the age of
seventy-five on 24 January 1634.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> His patent of appointment to the
Chapel Royal is dated 14 July and his commission 15 July 1597.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
They closely follow in terms those granted to Hunnis.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Three years later the theatrical enterprise which had been dropped in
1584 was renewed by Giles, in co-operation with Henry Evans, who had
been associated with its final stages. The locality chosen was again
the Blackfriars, in the building reconstructed by James Burbadge in
1596, and then inhibited, on a petition of the inhabitants, from use
as a public play-house. Of this, being ‘then or late in the tenure or
occupacion of’ Henry Evans, Richard Burbadge gave him on 2 September
1600 a lease for twenty-one years from the following Michaelmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> at a
rent of £40.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> According to Burbadge’s own account of the matter,
Evans ‘intended then presentlye to erect or sett vp a companye of boyes
... in the same’, and knowing that the payment of the rent depended
upon the possibility of maintaining a company ‘to playe playes and
interludes in the said Playhowse in such sort as before tyme had bene
there vsed’, he thought it desirable to take collateral security in
the form of a bond for £400 from Evans and his son-in-law Alexander
Hawkins.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Long after, the Blackfriars <i>Sharers Papers</i> of 1635
describe the lease as being to ‘one Evans that first sett vp the boyes
commonly called the Queenes Majesties Children of the Chapell’.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> I
find nothing in this language to bear out the contention of Professor
Wallace that Evans’s occupation of the Blackfriars extended back long
before the date of his lease, and that, as already suggested by Mr.
Fleay, the Chapel plays began again, not in 1600, but in 1597.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
Burbadge speaks clearly of the setting up of the company as still an
intention when the lease was drawn, and the reference to earlier plays
in the house may either be to some use of it unknown to us between 1596
and 1600, or perhaps more probably to the performances by Evans and
others before the time of James Burbadge’s reconstruction. Mr. Fleay’s
suggestion rested, so far as I can judge, upon the evidence for the
existence of Jonson’s <i>Case is Altered</i> as early as January 1599
and its publication as ‘acted by the children of the Blacke-friers’.
But this publication was not until 1609 and represents a revision
made not long before that date; and as will be seen the company
did not use the name Children of the Blackfriars until about 1606.
There is no reason to suppose that they were the original producers
of the play. A confirmatory indication for 1600 as the date of the
revival may be found in the appearance of the Chapel at Court, for
the first time since 1584, on 6 January and 22 February 1601. On both
occasions Nathaniel Giles was payee. The performance of 6 January,
described by the Treasurer of the Chamber as ‘a showe with musycke
and speciall songes’ was probably Jonson’s <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
which that description well fits; that of 22 February may have been
the anonymous <i>Contention between Liberality and Prodigality</i>.
Both of these were published in 1601. Jonson has preserved for us in
his Folio of 1616 the list of the principal actors of <i>Cynthia’s
Revels</i>, who were ‘Nat. Field, Sal. Pavy, Tho. Day, Ioh. Underwood,
Rob. Baxter and Ioh. Frost’. The induction of the play is spoken by
‘Iacke’ and two other of the Children, of whom one, impersonating a
spectator, complains that ‘the vmbrae, or ghosts of some three or
foure playes, departed a dozen yeeres since, haue bin seene walking
on your stage heere’. <i>Liberality and Prodigality</i> may be one
of the old-fashioned plays here scoffed at, but it is probable that
Jonson also had in mind Lyly’s <i>Love’s Metamorphosis</i>, which
was published in 1601 as ‘first playd by the Children of Paules, and
now by the Children of the Chappell’, and there may have been other
revivals of the same kind. The company was included in the Lenten
prohibition of 11 March 1601. Later in the year they produced Jonson’s
<i>Poetaster</i>, containing raillery of the common stages, which
stimulated a reply in Dekker’s <i>Satiromastix</i>, and which, together
with their growing popularity, sufficiently explains the reference
to the ‘aerie of children, little eyases’ in <i>Hamlet</i>.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
The <i>Poetaster</i> was published in 1602 and the actor-list of
the Folio of 1616 contains the names of ‘Nat. Field, Sal Pavy, Tho.
Day, Ioh. Underwood, Wil. Ostler and Tho. Marton’. The full name of
Pavy, who died after acting for three years, is given as Salathiel
in the epigram written to his memory by Jonson; it appears as Salmon
in a document which adds considerably to our knowledge both of the
original constitution of the company and of the lines on which it
was managed. This is a complaint to the Star Chamber by one Henry
Clifton, Esq., of Toftrees, Norfolk, against a serious abuse of the
powers of impressment entrusted under the royal commission to Nathaniel
Giles.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Clifton alleged that Giles, in confederacy with Evans,
one James Robinson and others, had set up a play-house for their own
profit in the Blackfriars, and under colour of the commission had taken
boys, not for the royal service in the Chapel Royal, but employment in
acting interludes. He specified as so taken, ‘John Chappell, a gramer
schole scholler of one Mr. Spykes schole neere Criplegate, London;
John Motteram, a gramer scholler in the free schole at Westmi[n]ster;
Nathan ffield, a scholler of a gramer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> schole in London, kepte by one
Mr. Monkaster; Alvery Trussell, an apprentice to one Thomas Gyles;
one Phillipp Pykman and Thomas Grymes, apprentices to Richard and
Georg Chambers; Salmon Pavey, apprentice to one Peerce’. These were
all children ‘noe way able or fitt for singing, nor by anie the sayd
confederates endevoured to be taught to singe’. Finally they had
made an attempt upon Clifton’s own son Thomas, a boy of thirteen,
who had been seized by Robinson in Christ Church cloister on or
about 13 December 1600, as he went from Clifton’s house in Great St.
Bartholomew’s to the grammar school at Christ Church, and carried off
to the play-house ‘to exercyse the base trade of a mercynary enterlude
player, to his vtter losse of tyme, ruyne and disparagment’. Clifton
went to the Blackfriars, where his son was ‘amongste a companie of
lewde and dissolute mercenary players’, and made a protest; but Giles,
Robinson, and Evans replied that ‘yf the Queene would not beare them
furth in that accion, she should gett another to execute her comission
for them’, that ‘they had aucthoritie sufficient soe to take any noble
mans sonne in this land’, and that ‘were yt not for the benefitt they
made by the sayd play howse, whoe would, should serve the Chappell
with children for them’. Then they committed Thomas Clifton to the
charge of Evans in his father’s presence, with a threat of a whipping
if he was not obedient, and ‘did then and there deliuer vnto his sayd
sonne, in moste scornefull disdaynfull and dispightfull manner, a
scrolle of paper, conteyning parte of one of theire sayd playes or
enterludes, and him, the sayd Thomas Clifton, comaunded to learne
the same by harte’. Clifton appealed to Sir John Fortescue and got
a warrant from him for the boy’s release after a day and a night’s
durance. It was not, however, until a year later, on 15 December 1601,
that he made his complaint.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> During the following Christmas Giles
brought the boys to Court on 6 and 10 January and 14 February 1602,
and then with the hearing of the case in the Star Chamber during
Hilary Term troubles began for the syndicate. Evans was censured ‘for
his vnorderlie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> carriage and behauiour in takinge vp of gentlemens
childeren against theire wills and to ymploy them for players and
for other misdemeanors’, and it was decreed that all assurances made
to him concerning the play-house or plays should be void and should
be delivered up to be cancelled.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Evans, however, had apparently
prepared himself against this contingency by assigning his lease to
his son-in-law Alexander Hawkins on 21 October 1601. This at least
is one explanation of a somewhat obscure transaction. According to
Evans himself, the assignment was to protect Hawkins from any risk
upon the bond given to Burbadge. On the other hand, there had already
been negotiations for the sale of a half interest in the undertaking
to three new partners, Edward Kirkham, William Rastall, and Thomas
Kendall, and it was claimed later by Kirkham that the assignment to
Hawkins had been in trust to reassign a moiety to these three, in
return for a contribution of capital variously stated at from £300 to
£600. No such reassignment was, however, carried out.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> But although
the lease from Burbadge was certainly not cancelled as a result of the
Star Chamber decree, it probably did seem prudent that the original
managers of the theatre should remain in the background for a time.
Nothing more is heard of James Robinson, while the partnership between
Evans and Hawkins on the one side and Kirkham, Rastall, and Kendall on
the other was brought into operation under articles dated on 20 April
1602. For the observance of these Evans and Hawkins gave a bond of
£200.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Kirkham, Rastall, and Kendall in turn gave Evans a bond of
£50 as security<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> for a weekly payment of 8s., ‘because after the said
agreements made, the complainant [Kirkham] and his said parteners would
at their directions haue the dieting and ordering of the boyes vsed
about the plaies there, which before the said complainant had, and for
the which he had weekely before that disbursed and allowed great sommes
of monie’.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Of the new managers, Rastall was a merchant and Kendall a haberdasher,
both of London.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Kirkham has generally been assumed to be the
Yeoman of the Revels, but of this there is not, so far as I know,
any definite proof. The association did not prove an harmonious one.
According to Evans, Kirkham and his fellows made false information
against him to the Lord Chamberlain, as a result of which he was
‘comaunded by his Lordship to avoyd and leave the same’, had to quit
the country, and lost nearly £300 by the charge he was put to and the
negligence of Hawkins in looking after his profits.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This seems
to have been in May 1602. Meanwhile the performances continued. The
company did not appear at Court during the winter of 1602–3, but <i>Sir
Giles Goosecap</i> and possibly Chapman’s <i>Gentleman Usher</i>
were produced by them before the end of Elizabeth’s reign; and on 18
September 1602 a visit was paid to the theatre by Philipp Julius, Duke
of Stettin-Pomerania, of which the following account is preserved in
the journal of Frederic Gerschow, a member of his suite:<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Von dannen sind wir auf die Kinder-comoediam gangen, welche

</div>

<p class="p-left">This report of a foreigner must not be pressed as if it were precise
evidence upon the business organization of the Blackfriars. Yet it
forms the main basis of the theory propounded by Professor Wallace
that Elizabeth personally financed the Chapel plays and personally
directed the limitation of the number of adult companies allowed to
perform in London, as part of a deliberate scheme of reform, which
her ‘definite notion of what the theatre should be’ had led her to
plan&mdash;a theory which, I fear, makes his <i>Children of the Chapel at
Blackfriars</i> misleading, in spite of its value as a review of the
available evidence, old and new, about the company.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Professor
Wallace supposes that Edward Kirkham, acting officially as Yeoman of
the Revels, was Elizabeth’s agent, and that, even before he became a
partner in the syndicate, he dieted the boys and supplied them with the
‘köstlichen Kleidern zum Ueberfluss’ mentioned by Gerschow, accounting
for the expenditure either through the Revels Accounts or through some
other unspecified accounts ‘yet to be discovered’.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Certainly
no such expenditure appeared in the Revels Accounts, and no other
official account with which Kirkham was concerned is known. It may be
pointed out that, if we took Gerschow’s account as authoritative, we
should have to suppose that Elizabeth provided the theatre building,
which we know she did not, and I think it may be taken for granted
that her payments for the Chapel were no more than those with which
we are already quite familiar, namely the Master’s fee of £40 ‘pro
exhibicione puerorum’, the board-wages of 6<i>d.</i> a day for each
of twelve children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> possibly the breakfast allowance of £16 a year
and the largess of £9 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for high feasts, and the
occasional rewards for actual performances. None of these, of course,
passed through the Revels Office, and although this office may, as in
the past, have helped to furnish the actual plays at Court, the cost
of exercising in public remained a speculation of the Master and his
backers, who had to look for recoupment and any possible profits to
the sums received from spectators. If it is true, as Gerschow seems
to say, that performances were only given on Saturdays, the high
entrance charge of 1<i>s.</i> is fully explained. The lawsuits, of
course, bear full evidence to the expenditure by the members of the
syndicate upon the ‘setting forward’ of plays.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Nor is there any
ground for asserting, as Professor Wallace does, that there were two
distinct sets of children, one lodged in or near the palace for chapel
purposes proper, and the other kept at the Blackfriars for plays.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
It is true that Clifton charged Giles with impressing boys who could
not sing, but Gerschow’s account proves that there were others at the
Blackfriars who could sing well enough, and it would be absurd to
suppose that there was one trained choir for the stage and another for
divine service. Doubtless, however, the needs of the theatre made it
necessary to employ, by agreement or impressment, a larger number of
boys than the twelve borne on the official establishment.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> And that
boys whose voices had broken were retained in the theatrical company
may be inferred from the report about 1602 that the Dowager Countess of
Leicester had married ‘one of the playing boyes of the chappell’.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
I cannot, finally, agree with Professor Wallace in assuming that the
play attended by Elizabeth at the Blackfriars on 29 December 1601 was
necessarily a public one at the theatre; much less that it was ‘only
one in a series of such attendances’. She had dined with Lord Hunsdon
at his house in the Blackfriars. The play may have been in his great
chamber, or he may have borrowed the theatre next door for private use
on an off-day. And the actors may even more probably have been his own
company than the Chapel boys.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>The appointment of a new Lord Chamberlain by James I seems to have
enabled Evans to return to England. He found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> theatrical affairs in a
bad way, owing to the plague of 1603, and ‘speach and treatie’ arose
between him and Burbadge about a possible surrender of his lease.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
By December, however, things looked brighter. Evans did some repairs
to the Blackfriars, and the enterprise continued.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Like the adult
companies, the partners secured direct royal protection under the
following patent of 4 February 1604:<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">Apparently it was still thought better to keep the name of Evans out of
the patent, and he was represented by Hawkins; of the nature of Payne’s
connexion with the company I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> nothing. The adoption of the name of
Children of the Queen’s Revels should perhaps be taken as indicating
that, as the boy-actors grew older, the original connexion with the
Chapel became looser. The use of Giles’s commission as a method of
obtaining recruits was probably abandoned, and there is no evidence
that he had any further personal association with the theatre.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
The commission itself was, however, renewed on 13 September 1604,
with a new provision for the further education of boys whose voices
had changed;<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and in December Giles was successful in getting
the board-wages allowed for his charges raised from 6<i>d.</i> to
10<i>d.</i> a day.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The Revels children started gaily on the new phase of their career,
and the <i>Hamlet</i> allusion is echoed in Middleton’s advice to a
gallant, ‘if his humour so serve him, to call in at the Blackfriars,
where he should see a nest of boys able to ravish a man’.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> They
were at Court on 21 February 1604 and on 1 and 3 January 1605. Their
payees were Kirkham for the first year and Evans and Daniel for
the second. Evidently Daniel was taking a more active part in the
management than that of a mere licenser. Their play of 1 January 1605
was Chapman’s <i>All Fools</i> (1605), and to 1603–5 may also be
assigned his <i>Monsieur d’Olive</i> (1606), and possibly his <i>Bussy
d’Ambois</i> (1607), and <i>Day’s Law Tricks</i> (1608). I venture to
conjecture that the boys’ companies were much more under the influence
of their poets than were their adult rivals; it is noteworthy that
plays written for them got published much more rapidly than the King’s
or Prince’s men ever permitted.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> And it is known that one poet,
who now began for the first time to work for the Blackfriars, acquired
a financial interest in the undertaking. This was John Marston, to
whom Evans parted, at an unspecified date, with a third of the moiety
which the arrangement of 1602 had left on his hands.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Marston’s
earliest contributions were probably <i>The Malcontent</i> (1604)
and <i>The Dutch Courtesan</i> (1605). From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> the induction to the
<i>Malcontent</i> we learn that it was appropriated by the King’s
men, in return for the performance by the boys of a play on Jeronimo,
perhaps the extant <i>I Jeronimo</i>, in which the King’s claimed
rights. Marston’s satirical temper did not, however, prove altogether
an asset to the company; and I fear that the deference of its directors
to literary suggestions was not compatible with that practical
political sense, which as a rule enabled the professional players to
escape conflicts with authority. The history of the next few years is
one of a series of indiscretions, which render it rather surprising
that the company should throughout have succeeded in maintaining its
vitality, even with the help of constant reconstructions of management
and changes of name. The first trouble, the nature of which is unknown,
appears to have been caused by Marston’s <i>Dutch Courtesan</i>.
Then came, ironically enough, the <i>Philotas</i> of the company’s
official censor, Samuel Daniel. Then, in 1605, the serious affair of
<i>Eastward Ho!</i> for which Marston appears to have been mainly
responsible, although he saved himself by flight, whereas his fellow
authors, Jonson and Chapman, found themselves in prison and in imminent
danger of losing their ears.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> I do not think that the scandal
arose on the performance of the play, but on its publication in the
late autumn.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The company did not appear at Court during the
winter of 1605–6, but the ingenious Kirkham seems to have succeeded in
transferring one of its new plays, Marston’s <i>Fawn</i>, and possibly
also <i>Bussy D’Ambois</i>, to Paul’s, and appeared triumphantly before
the Treasurer of the Chamber’s paymaster the following spring as ‘one
of the Masters of the Children of Pawles’. Meanwhile the Blackfriars
company went on acting, but it is to be inferred from the title-pages
of its next group of plays, Marston’s <i>Sophonisba</i> (1606),
Sharpham’s <i>The Fleir</i> (1607), and Day’s <i>Isle of Gulls</i>
(1606), that its misdemeanour had cost it the direct patronage of the
Queen, and that it was now only entitled to call itself, not Children
of the Queen’s Revels, but Children of the Revels.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Possibly
the change of name also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> indicates that thereafter, not Daniel, but
the Master of the Revels, acted as its censor. Anne herself, by the
way, must have felt the snub, for it was probably at the Blackfriars
that, if the French ambassador may be trusted, she had attended
representations ‘to enjoy the laugh against her husband’.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The
alias, whatever it connoted, proved but an ephemeral one. By February
1606 one of the plays just named, the <i>Isle of Gulls</i>, had given
a new offence. Some of those responsible for it were thrown into
Bridewell, and a fresh reconstruction became imperative.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> It was
probably at this date that one Robert Keysar, a London goldsmith, came
into the business. Kirkham, like Evans before him, discreetly retired
from active management, and the Children, with Keysar as ‘interest
with them’, became ‘Masters themselves’, taking the risks and paying
the syndicate for the use of the hall.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Kirkham claims that under
this arrangement the moiety of profits in which he had rights amounted
to £150 a year, as against £100 a year previously earned.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Shortly
afterwards the dissociation of the Chapel from the Blackfriars was
completed by a new commission issued to Giles on 7 November 1606, to
which was added the following clause:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Prouided alwayes and wee doe straightlie charge and commaunde
that none of the saide Choristers or Children of the Chappell
so to be taken by force of this commission shalbe vsed or
imployed as Comedians or Stage players, or to exercise or acte
any Stage playes Interludes Comedies or tragedies, for that it
is not fitt or decent that such as shoulde singe the praises
of God Allmightie shoulde be trayned vpp or imployed in suche
lascivious and prophane exercises.’<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is presumably to this pronouncement that Flecknoe refers in 1664,
when he speaks of the Chapel theatre being converted to the use of the
Children of the Revels, on account of the growing precision of the
people and the growing licentiousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> of plays.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> It is, however,
curious to observe that the abandoned titles of the company tended to
linger on in actual use. Evans in 1612 speaks of the syndicate as ‘the
coparteners sharers, and Masters of the Queenes Maiesties Children
of the Revells (for so yt was often called)’ in 1608;<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> while the
name Children of the Chapel is used in the Stationers’ Register entry
of <i>Your Five Gallants</i> in 1608, at Maidstone in 1610, and even
in such official documents as the Revels Accounts for 1604–5 and the
Chamber Accounts for 1612–13.</p>

<p>Under Keysar the name was Children of the Blackfriars. For a couple
of years the company succeeded in keeping clear of further disaster.
But on 29 March 1608 the French ambassador, M. de la Boderie, reported
that all the London theatres had been closed, and were now threatened
by the King with a permanent inhibition on account of two plays which
had given the greatest offence.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Against one of these, which
dealt with the domestic affairs of the French king, he had himself
lodged a protest, and his description leaves no doubt that this was
one of the parts of Chapman’s <i>Conspiracy and Tragedy of Byron</i>,
which was published, without the offending scene, later in the year,
as ‘acted at the Black-Friars’. The other play was a personal attack
upon James himself. ‘Un jour ou deux devant’, says La Boderie, ‘ilz
avoient dépêché leur Roi, sa mine d’Escosse, et tous ses favorits
d’une estrange sorte; car aprés luy avoir fait dépiter le ciel sur
le vol d’un oyseau, et faict battre un gentilhomme pour avoir rompu
ses chiens, ils le dépeignoient ivre pour le moins une fois le jour.’
This piece is not extant, but I have recently come across another
allusion to it in a letter of 11 March 1608 to Lord Salisbury from
Sir Thomas Lake, a clerk of the signet in attendance upon the King at
Thetford.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘His ma<sup>tie</sup> was well pleased with that which your lo.
advertiseth concerning the committing of the players y<sup>t</sup>
have offended in y<sup>e</sup> matters of France, and commanded me to
signifye to your lo. that for y<sup>e</sup> others who have offended in
y<sup>e</sup> matter of y<sup>e</sup> Mynes and other lewd words, which is y<sup>e</sup>
children of y<sup>e</sup> blackfriars, That though he had signified

repeate it again, That his G. had vowed they should never play
more, but should first begg their bred and he wold have his vow
performed, And therefore my lo. chamberlain by himselfe or your
ll. at the table should take order to dissolve them, and to
punish the maker besides.’</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Thomas Lake appears to have been under the impression that two
companies were concerned, and that the ‘matters of France’ were
not played by the Children of Blackfriars. If so, we must suppose
that <i>Byron</i> was originally produced elsewhere, perhaps by the
King’s Revels, and transferred to the Blackfriars after ‘reformation’
by the Council. M. de la Boderie, however, writes as if the same
company were responsible for both plays, and perhaps it is on the
whole more probable that Sir Thomas Lake misunderstood the situation.
I feel very little doubt that the maker of the play on the mines
was once more Marston, who was certainly summoned before the Privy
Council and committed to Newgate, on some offence not specified in
the extant record, on 8 June 1608.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> And this was probably the
end of his stormy connexion with the stage. He disappeared from
the Blackfriars and from literary life, leaving <i>The Insatiate
Countess</i> unfinished, and selling the share in the syndicate
which he had acquired from Evans about 1603 to Robert Keysar for
£100. Before making his purchase, Keysar, who tells us that he put
a value of £600 on the whole of the enterprise, got an assurance,
as he thought, from the King’s men that they would not come to any
arrangement with Henry Evans which would prejudice his interests.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
This the King’s men afterwards denied, and as a matter of fact the
negotiations, tentatively opened as far back as 1603, between Evans
and Burbadge for a surrender of the lease were now coming to a head,
and its actual surrender took place about August 1608.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> On the
ninth of that month Burbadge executed fresh leases of the theatre to
a new syndicate representing the King’s men.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The circumstances
leading up to Evans’s part in this transaction became subsequently
the subject of hostile criticism by Kirkham, who asserted that the
lease, which Alexander Hawkins held in trust, had been stolen from his
custody by Mrs. Evans, and that the surrender was effected with the
fraudulent intention of excluding Kirkham from the profits to which he
was entitled under the settlement of 1602.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> According to Evans,
however, Kirkham was at least implicitly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> a consenting party, for it
was he who, after the King’s inhibition had brought the profits to an
end, grew weary of the undertaking and initiated measures for winding
it up. On or about 26 July 1608 he had had the ‘apparells, properties
and goods’ of the syndicate appraised and an equitable division made.
When some of the boys were committed to prison he had ‘said he would
deale no more with yt, “for”, quoth he, “yt is a base thing”, or vsed
wordes to such, or very like effect’. And he had ‘delivered up their
commission, which he had vnder the greate seale aucthorising them to
plaie, and discharged divers of the partners and poetts’. In view of
this, Evans claimed that he was fully justified in coming to terms with
Burbadge.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>After all, the King’s anger proved only a flash in the pan. Perhaps
the company travelled during the summer of 1608, if they, and not
the King’s Revels, were ‘the Children of the Revells’ rewarded at
Leicester on 21 August.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> But by the following Christmas they were
in London, and with Keysar as their payee gave three plays at Court,
where they had not put in an appearance since 1604–5. Two of these were
on 1 and 4 January 1609. As they still bore the name of Children of
Blackfriars, they had presumably remained on sufferance in their old
theatre, which the King’s men may not have been in a hurry to occupy
during a plague-stricken period.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> But when a new season opened in
the autumn of 1609, new quarters became necessary. These they found at
Whitefriars, which had been vacated by the failure of the short-lived
King’s Revels company, and it was as the Children of Whitefriars that
Keysar brought them to Court for no less than five plays during the
winter of 1609–10. He had now enlisted a partner in Philip Rosseter,
one of the lutenists of the royal household, who carried out a scheme,
with the co-operation of the King’s men, for buying off with a ‘dead
rent’ the possible competition of the Paul’s boys, who had closed their
doors about 1606, but might at any moment open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> them again.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> More
than this, through the influence of Sir Thomas Monson, Rosseter was
successful in obtaining a new patent, dated on 4 January 1610, by which
the Children once more became entitled to call themselves Children of
the Queen’s Revels.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> It ran as follows:</p>

<p class="p-left">Of the new syndicate Browne and Jones were old professional actors
who had belonged to the Admiral’s men a quarter of a century before,
and had since been prominent, Browne in particular, as organizers
of English companies for travel in Germany. Daborne was or became a
playwright. Of Tarbock I know nothing; he may have been a nominee of
Keysar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> whose own name, perhaps for reasons of diplomacy, does not
appear in the patent. He may, of course, have retired, but a lawsuit
which he brought in 1610 suggests that his connexion with the company
was not altogether broken. The Whitefriars had not the tradition of
the Blackfriars, and Keysar was aggrieved at the surrender of the
Blackfriars lease by Evans over his head. On 8 February 1610 he laid a
bill in the Court of Requests against the housekeepers of the King’s
men, claiming a share in their profits since the date of surrender,
which he estimated at £1,500, on the strength of the one-sixth interest
in the lease assigned by Evans to Marston and by Marston to him.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
He asserted that he had kept boys two years in the hope of playing
‘vpon the ceasing of the generall sicknes’, and had spent £500 on
that and on making provision in the house, and had now, at a loss of
£1,000, had to disperse ‘a companye of the moste exparte and skilful
actors within the realme of England to the number of eighteane or
twentye persons all or moste of them trayned vp in that service, in
the raigne of the late Queene Elizabeth for ten yeares togeather and
afterwardes preferred into her Maiesties service to be the Chilldren
of her Revells’.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Burbadge and his fellows denied that they had
made £1,500, or that they had attempted to defraud Keysar either about
the surrender of the lease or, as he also alleged, the ‘dead rent’ to
Paul’s, and they pointed out that his losses were really due to the
plague. He could recover his share of the theatrical stock from Evans.
Evans had had no legal right to assign his interest under the lease.
As only the pleadings in the case and not the depositions or the order
of the court are extant, we do not know what Evans, who was to be a
witness, had to say.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The fact that one of the new Blackfriars
leases of 1608 was to a Thomas Evans leaves the transaction between
Henry Evans and Burbadge not altogether free from a suspicion of bad
faith. Kirkham also found that he had been either hasty or outwitted in
1608, and as the deaths of Rastall and Kendall in that year had left
him the sole claimant to any interest under the arrangement of 1602, he
had recourse to litigation. In the course of 1611 and 1612 he brought
a ‘multiplicitie of suites’ against Evans and Hawkins, and was finally
non-suited in the King’s Bench.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Then, in May 1612, Evans in his
turn brought a Chancery action against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> Kirkham, in the hope of getting
his bond of 1602 cancelled, and thus securing himself against any
further persecution for petty breaches of the articles of agreement.
The result of this is unknown, but in the course of it many of the
incidents of 1600–8 were brought into question, and Kirkham claimed
that not merely had Evans shut him out in 1604 from certain rooms in
the Blackfriars which he was entitled to use, but that by the surrender
of the lease in 1608 he had lost profits which he estimated at £60
a year.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Finally in July 1612 Kirkham brought a Chancery action
against Evans, Burbadge, and John Heminges, and also against the widow
of Alexander Hawkins and Edward Painton, to whom she was now married,
for reinstatement in his moiety of the lease. In this suit much of the
same ground was again traversed, but the Court refused to grant him any
relief.</p>

<p>It is not altogether easy to disentangle the plays produced at the
Blackfriars under Keysar from those produced immediately afterwards
at the Whitefriars. The only title-page which definitely names the
Children of the Blackfriars is that of Jonson’s <i>The Case is
Altered</i> (1609). But Chapman’s <i>Byron</i> (1608) and <i>May
Day</i> (1611) and Middleton’s <i>Your Five Gallants</i> (n.d.?1608)
also claim to have been acted at the Blackfriars. The Q<sub>1</sub> of
Middleton’s <i>A Trick to Catch the Old One</i> (1608) assigns it to
Paul’s; the Q<sub>2</sub> both to Paul’s and Blackfriars, with an indication
of a Court performance on New Year’s Day, which can only be that of
1 January 1609. This play, therefore, must have been taken over from
Paul’s, when that house closed in 1606 or 1607. As Middleton is not
generally found writing for Blackfriars, <i>Your Five Gallants</i> may
have been acquired in the same way. It is also extremely likely that
Chapman’s <i>Bussy d’Ambois</i> passed from Paul’s to Blackfriars on
its way to the King’s men. No name of company or theatre is attached
to Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>Knight of the Burning Pestle</i> (1613)
or to <i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i> (<i>c.</i> 1609). But the <i>K.
B. P.</i> was published with an epistle to Keysar as its preserver and
can be securely dated in 1607–8; it refers to the house in which it
was played as having been open for seven years, which just fits the
Blackfriars. <i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i> is of 1608–9 and a boys’
play; the commendatory verses by Field, Jonson, and Chapman justify an
attribution to the company with which they had to do. Chapman’s <i>The
Widow’s Tears</i> (1612) had been staged both at Blackfriars and at
Whitefriars before publication, and was probably therefore produced
shortly before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> company moved house. The greatest difficulty is
Jonson’s <i>Epicoene</i> (S. R. 20 September 1610). No edition is
known to be extant earlier than the Folio of 1616, in which Jonson
ascribed the production to ‘1609’ and to the Children of the Revels.
According to the system of dating ordinarily adopted by Jonson in this
Folio, ‘1609’ should mean 1609 and not 1609–10. Yet the Children were
not entitled to call themselves ‘of the Revels’ during 1609. Either
Jonson’s chronology or his memory of the shifting nomenclature of the
company has slipped. The actor-list of <i>Epicoene</i> names ‘Nat.
Field, Gil. Carie, Hug. Attawel, Ioh. Smith, Will. Barksted, Will.
Pen, Ric. Allin, Ioh. Blaney’. Amongst these Field is the sole direct
connecting link with the Chapel actor-lists of 1600 and 1601. Keysar’s
pleading shows us that from 1600 to 1610 the company had maintained
a substantial identity throughout all its phases, as successively
Children of the Chapel, Children of the Queen’s Revels, Children of the
Blackfriars, Children of the Whitefriars; but part of his grievance is
its dispersal, and possibly the continuity with the second Children
of the Revels may not have been quite so marked. ‘In processe of
time’, say the Burbadges in the <i>Blackfriars Sharers Papers</i> of
1635, ‘the boyes growing up to bee men, which were Underwood, Field,
Ostler, and were taken to strengthen the King’s service’.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> This,
which is written in relation to the acquisition of the Blackfriars, is
doubtless accurate as regards Ostler and Underwood, and their transfer
may reasonably be placed in the winter of 1609–10. But it was not until
some years later that Field joined the King’s men.</p>

<p>The career of the second Queen’s Revels, but for the temporary
suppression of <i>Epicoene</i> owing to a misconstruction placed on it
by Arabella Stuart, was comparatively uneventful. They are recorded at
Maidstone as the Children of the Chapel about March 1610. They made
no appearance at Court during the following winter, and were again
travelling in the following autumn, when they came to Norwich under
the leadership of one Ralph Reeve, who showed the patent of 4 January
1610, and at first claimed to be Rosseter, but afterwards admitted
that he was not. As he could show no letters of deputation, he was not
allowed to play, although he received a reward on the following day,
which was recorded, not quite correctly, as paid to ‘the master of the
children of the King’s Revells’. By 29 August Barksted and Carey had
left the company to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> join the newly formed Lady Elizabeth’s men. We may
therefore place at some time before this date Barksted’s completion
of Marston’s <i>Insatiate Countess</i>, which was published in 1613
as ‘acted at Whitefriars’. The entry in the Stationer’s Register of
Field’s <i>A Woman is a Weathercock</i> (1612) on 23 November 1611
shows that he also had begun to experiment in authorship. As this had
been acted at Court, as well as by the Queen’s Revels at Whitefriars,
it probably dates back to the winter of 1609–10. The company returned
to court on 5 January 1612 with Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>Cupid’s
Revenge</i>, and the Clerk of the Revels entered them as the Children
of Whitefriars.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The travels of 1612 were under the leadership of
Nicholas Long, and on 20 May another <i>contretemps</i> occurred at
Norwich. The instrument of deputation was forthcoming on this occasion,
but the mayor chose to interpret the patent as giving authority only
to teach and instruct children, and not to perform with them; and so
once again ‘the Master of the Kings Revells’ got his reward of 20s.,
but was not allowed to play. Between Michaelmas and Christmas ‘the
queens maiesties revellers’ were at Bristol, and at some time during
1612–13 ‘two of the company of the childeren of Revells’ received a
reward at Coventry. Conceivably the provincial company of Reeve and
Long was a distinct organization from that in London. Rosseter was
payee for four performances at Court during the winter of 1612–13. On
the first occasion, in the course of November, the play was Beaumont
and Fletcher’s <i>Coxcomb</i>; on 1 January and again on 9 January it
was <i>Cupid’s Revenge</i>; and on 27 February it was <i>The Widow’s
Tears</i>. In one version of the <i>Chamber Accounts</i> the company
appears this year as the Children of the Queen’s Revels, but in another
under the obsolete designation of Children of the Chapel. In addition
to the plays already named, Chapman’s <i>Revenge of Bussy</i> had been
on the Whitefriars stage before it was published in 1613; and it is
conceivable that Chapman’s <i>Chabot</i> and Beaumont and Fletcher’s
<i>Monsieur Thomas</i> and <i>The Nightwalker</i> may be Queen’s
Revels plays of 1610–13. They may also, indeed, be Lady Elizabeth’s
plays of 1613–16, but during this period the Lady Elizabeth and the
Queen’s Revels appear to have been practically amalgamated, under an
arrangement made between Henslowe and Rosseter in March 1613 and then
modified, first in 1614, and again on the addition of Prince Charles’s
men to the ‘combine’ in 1615. Yet in some way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> the Children of the
Revels maintained a separate individuality, at least in theory, during
these years, as may be seen from the patent of 3 June 1615, which
licensed Rosseter and Reeve, together with Robert Jones and Philip
Kingman, to build a new Blackfriars theatre in the house known as
Porter’s Hall.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The main purpose of this undertaking was expressed
to be the provision of a new house for the Children of the Queen’s
Revels instead of the Whitefriars, where Rosseter’s lease was now
expired, although it was also contemplated that use might be made of it
by the Prince’s and the Lady Elizabeth’s players. Porter’s Hall only
stood for a short time before civic hostility procured its demolition,
and the single play, which we can be fairly confident that the Children
of the Revels gave in it, is Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>Scornful
Lady</i>. This presumably fell after the amalgamation under Henslowe
broke up about the time of his death early in 1616. Field appears to
have joined the King’s men about 1615. The Queen’s Revels dropped out
of London theatrical life. Their provincial travels under Nicholas Long
had apparently terminated in 1612, as in 1614 he is found using the
patent of the Lady Elizabeth’s men (q. v.) in the provinces. But some
members of the company seem to have gone travelling during the period
of troubled relations with Henslowe, and are traceable at Coventry on
7 October 1615, and at Nottingham in February 1616 and again later in
1616–17. On 31 October 1617 a new Queen’s Revel’s company was formed by
Rosseter, in association with Nicholas Long, Robert Lee of the Queen’s
men, and William Perry of the King’s Revels.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>


<h5>iii. THE CHILDREN OF WINDSOR</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Masters of the Children</i>:&mdash;Richard Farrant (1564–80),
Nathaniel Giles (1595–1634).</p>
</div>

<p>The Chapel Royal at Windsor was served by an ecclesiastical college,
which had been in existence as far back as the reign of Henry I, and
had subsequently been resettled as St. George’s Chapel in connexion
with the establishment of the Order of the Garter by Edward III,
finally incorporated under Edward IV, and exempted from dissolution at
the Reformation. Edward III had provided for a warden, who afterwards
came to be called dean, 12 canons, 13 priest vicars, 4 clerks, 6 boy
choristers, and 26 ‘poor knights’. The boys were to be ‘endued with
clear and tuneable voices’, and to succeed the clerks as their voices
changed. Their number was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> altered from time to time; during the
greater part of Elizabeth’s reign it stood at 10. Each had an annual
fee of £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> They were lodged within the Castle, in
a chamber north of the chapel, and next to a building founded by James
Denton in 1520, known as the ‘New Commons’. This is now merged in the
canons’ houses, but a doorway is inscribed ‘Edes pro Sacellaenorum
et Choristarum conviviis extructae <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1519’. There were
also an epistoler and a gospeller.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The music was ‘useyd after ye
order and maner of ye quenes chappell’.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> One of the clerks, whose
position corresponded to that of the Gentlemen of the household Chapel
Royal, was appointed by the Chapter of the College to act as Organist
and Master of the Children. The College was privileged, like the Chapel
Royal itself, to recruit its choir by impressment. A commission for
this purpose, issued on 8 March 1560, merely repeats the terms of one
granted by Mary, which itself had confirmed earlier grants by Henry
VIII and Edward VI.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>The Master at Elizabeth’s accession was one Preston.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> But he was
deprived, as unwilling to accept the new ecclesiastical settlement;
and the first Master under whom the choristers appear to have acted at
Court was Richard Farrant. He had been a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal
from about 1553, but was replaced on 24 April 1564, doubtless on his
appointment as Master at Windsor.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> On the following 30 September
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> Chapter assigned a chantry to the teacher of the choristers for
an increase of his maintenance.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> On 5 November 1570, Farrant was
reappointed a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, but evidently did not
resign his Mastership.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> On 11 February 1567 he began a series of
plays with the ‘Children of Windsor’ at Court, which was continued at
Shrovetide 1568, on 22 February and 27 December 1569, at Shrovetide
1571, on 1 January 1572, when he gave <i>Ajax and Ulysses</i>, on 1
January 1573, on 6 January 1574, when he gave <i>Quintus Fabius</i>,
on 6 January 1575, when he gave <i>King Xerxes</i>, and on 27 December
1575. With the winter of 1576–7 the entries of his name in the accounts
of the Treasurer take a new form; he is no longer ‘M<sup>r</sup> of the children
of the Chappell at Wyndsore’ but ‘M<sup>r</sup> of the children of the Chappell’.
The Revels Accounts for the same season record that on 6 January
1577 <i>Mutius Scaevola</i> was played at Court by ‘the Children of
Windsore and the Chappell’, and it is a fair inference that Farrant, in
addition to exercising his own office, was now also acting as deputy
to William Hunnis, the Master by patent of the Children of the Chapel
Royal, and had made up a combined company from both choirs for the
Christmas delectation of the Queen.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> This interpretation of the
facts was confirmed when Professor Feuillerat was able to show from the
Loseley archives that in 1576 Farrant had taken a lease of rooms in the
Blackfriars from Sir William More and had converted them into the first
Blackfriars theatre.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Whether boys from Windsor continued to take
a share in the performances by the Chapel during 1577–8, 1578–9, and
1579–80, for all of which Farrant was payee, we do not know; there is
no further mention of them as actors in the Court accounts, although
they accompanied the singing men from Windsor to Reading during the
progress of 1576.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Farrant died on 30 November 1580, leaving a
widow Anne, who in 1582 obtained the reversion of a small lease from
the Crown, and was involved in controversies with Sir William More over
the Blackfriars tenement at least up to 1587.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He had acquired some
reputation as a musician, and amongst his surviving compositions are
a few which may have been intended for use in plays.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Farrant was
succeeded at Windsor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> by Nathaniel Giles, but only after an interval
of either five or fifteen years. Ashmole reports Giles’s monument as
crediting him with forty-nine years’ service as Master of St. George’s
before his death in 1634.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> There must be an inaccuracy, either
here or in the date of 1 October ’37 Eliz.’ (1595) upon a copy of his
indenture of appointment by the Windsor chapter, which is amongst
Ashmole’s papers.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> This recites that the chapter ‘are now destitute
of an experte and cunnynge man’, and that Giles ‘is well contented to
come and serve’ them. He is granted from the previous Michaelmas to
the end of his life ‘the Roome and place of a Clerk within the said
ffree Chappell and to be one of the Players on the Organes there,
and also the office of Instructor and Master of the ten Children
or Choristers of the same ffree Chappell, And the office of tutor,
creansor, or governor of the same tenn Children or Coristers’. He is
to have an annuity of £81 6s. 8d. and ‘tholde comons howse’, wherein
John Mundie lately dwelt, which he is to hold on the same terms as
‘one Richarde ffarrante enjoyed the same’ at a rent of £1 6<i>s.</i>
8<i>d.</i> His fee is to be ‘over and besides all such giftes, rewardes
or benevolences as from time to time during the naturall lief of him
the said Nathanaell Gyles shall be given bestowed or ymployed to or
upon the Choristers for singinge of Balattes, playes or for the like
respects whatsoever’. He is to maintain the children and to supply
vacancies, ‘her Maiesties comission for the taking of Children which
her highnes hath alredie graunted to the said Dean and Canons being
allowed vnto him the said Nathanaell Gyles for that purpose’. Evidently
the door was left open for a resumption of theatrical activities, such
as was afterwards brought about at the London Chapel Royal during the

<h5>iv. CHILDREN OF THE KING’S REVELS</h5>

<p class="center smaller"><i>Masters</i>:&mdash;Martin Slater and others.</p>

<div class="blockquot sm">

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The chief source of information
is J. Greenstreet, <i>The Whitefriars Theatre in the Time of
Shakspere</i> (<i>N. S. S. Trans. 1887–92</i>, 269), which gives

(1609, Chancery).]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>The accident of litigation brings into light a company of boys, who
appear to have acted for a brief and troubled period, which probably
ended in 1608 or early in 1609. The story is told by one George
Androwes a silk-weaver of London, and begins in February 1608. At
that date a part of the dissolved Whitefriars monastery was held, in
contemplation of a lease from Lord Buckhurst, by Michael Drayton and
Thomas Woodford. The lease was actually executed about the following
March, and was for six years, eight months, and twenty days, at a rent
of £50. Woodford had assigned his interest to one Lording Barry; and
Barry in turn persuaded Androwes to take over a third of it, and to
join a syndicate, of which the active manager was Martin Slater, who
is described as a citizen and ironmonger of London, but is, of course,
well known as an actor in the Admiral’s and other companies. The bill
incorporates the terms of Articles of Agreement entered into on 10
March 1608 by Slater on the one hand and Barry, Androwes, and Drayton,
together with William Trevell, William Cooke, Edward Sibthorpe, and
John Mason, all of London, gentlemen, on the other. They throw a
good deal of light upon the business organization of a theatrical
enterprise. Slater is to have a sixth part of the net profits of ‘any
playes, showes, interludes, musique, or such like exercises’ in the
Whitefriars play-house or elsewhere, together with lodging for himself
and his family on the premises, and any profits that can be made in the
house ‘either by wine, beere, ale, tobacco, wood, coales, or any such
commoditie’. When the ‘pattent for playinge’ shall be renewed, Slater’s
name is to be joined in it with Drayton’s, because ‘if any restrainte
of their playinge shall happen by reason of the plague or other
wise, it shalbe for more creditt of the whole company that the said
Martyn shall travel with the children, and acquainte the magistrates
with their busines’. During any such travel his allowance is to be
increased to a share and a half, no apparel, books, or other property
of the company is to be removed without the consent of the sharers,
and none of them is to print any of the play-books, ‘except the booke
of Torrismount, and that playe not to be printed by any before twelve
monthes be fully expired’. In order to avoid debt, a sixth part is
to be taken up each day of the ‘chardges of the howse’ for the week,
including ‘the gatherers, the wages, the childrens bourd, musique,
booke keeper, tyreman, tyrewoman, lights, the Maister of the revells’
duties, and all other things needefull and necessary’. The children are
to be ‘bound’ for three years to Slater, who undertakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> not to part
with ‘the said younge men or ladds’ during their apprenticeship except
on the consent of his fellow sharers.</p>

<p>The theatrical experience of the syndicate presumably rested with
Slater and Drayton. Of Trevell, Cooke, and Sibthorpe I know nothing,
except that Trevell, like Woodford, seems still to have had an interest
in the lease of the Whitefriars (cf. ch. xvii) in 1621. But Mason and
Barry were the authors respectively of <i>The Turk</i> (1610, S. R. 10
March 1609), and <i>Ram Alley</i> (1611, S. R. 9 November 1610), the
title-pages of which ascribe them to the children of the King’s Revels,
and thereby enable us to give a more definite title to the boys, who
are only described in the Chancery pleadings as ‘the Children of the
revells there beinge’, that is to say, at the Whitefriars. And we can
trace the King’s Revels a little farther back than February 1608 with
the aid of the earliest of similar entries on the title-pages of other
plays, which are, in the chronological order of publication, Sharpham’s
<i>Cupid’s Whirligig</i> (1607, S. R. 29 June 1607), Middleton’s
<i>Family of Love</i> (1608, S. R. 12 October 1607), Day’s <i>Humour
Out Of Breath</i> (1608, S. R. 12 April 1608), Markham’s (and Machin’s)
<i>The Dumb Knight</i> (1608, S. R. 6 October 1608), and Armin’s <i>Two
Maids of Moreclack</i> (1609). If Lewis Machin was the author of the
anonymous <i>Every Woman In Her Humour</i> (1609), it is possible that
this ought to be added to the list. Clearly the boys were playing at
least as early as the first half of 1607 and the agreement of 1608 must
represent a reconstruction of the original business organization. I
do not find anything in the plays to prove an earlier date than 1607,
but it is quite conceivable that the King’s Revels may have come into
existence as early as 1606, perhaps with the idea of replacing the
Queen’s Revels after their disgrace over <i>The Isle of Gulls</i>. But
if so, the Queen’s Revels managed to hold together under another name,
and in fact proved more enduring than their rivals. Mr. Fleay, however,
suggests that the King’s Revels were a continuation of the Paul’s boys,
and played at the singing-school, and apparently also that they were
themselves continued as the Duke of York’s men (<i>H. of S.</i> 152,
188, 202, 206). He did not, I think, know of <i>Androwes v. Slater</i>,
but <i>Androwes v. Slater</i> does not indicate that the King’s Revels
were at Whitefriars before 1608; rather the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The dates
render Mr. Fleay’s conjectures tempting, although it must be admitted
that there is not much evidence. But <i>The Family of Love</i> was
played in a round theatre and the Paul’s house was round.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> The curious
description of the Duke of York’s men at Leicester in 1608 as ‘of the
White Chapple, London’, might conceivably be a mistake for ‘of the
Whitefriars’, but more probably indicates that they came from the
Boar’s Head (cf. ch. xvi). ‘The Children of the Revells’ followed them
at Leicester on 21 August 1608, but these may have been the Blackfriars
children under a not quite official name. A complete search through
the Patent Rolls for 1606–8 might disinter the patent for the King’s
Revels, which is referred to in the Articles of Agreements; I find
no obvious clue to it in the printed index of signet bills. It seems
possible that William Barksted (cf. ch. xv) may have belonged to the
King’s Revels.</p>

<p>The syndicate did not hold together long. It will be noticed that, in
spite of the attempt in the articles to bar the printing of plays,
these had begun to reach the stationers again as early as April 1608.
The inhibition of 1608 hardly gave the company a chance, and then came
the plague. They were probably broken before the end of 1608, and
although Mason and Barry had at least the consolation that they had
got their own plays staged, other members of the syndicate could only
reflect that they had lost their money. And when dissensions broke
out, and Slater sued Androwes on a bond of £200 given by the sharers
for observance of the articles, and this for defaults which Androwes
himself had not committed, it is not surprising that Androwes drew the
conclusion that he had been a gull. He took Slater to Chancery, and
alleged that he had been asked £90 and paid £70 for his share in the
expectation of a profit of £100 a year, and on the understanding that
the apparel was worth £400 when it was not worth £5, that he had been
led into building and other expenses to the tune of £300, that the
lease had been forfeited for non-payment of rent before any assignation
had been made to him, and that he had been clearly told by Slater
that his obligation was not to extend beyond any breaches of covenant
that he might himself commit. Slater denied any responsibility for
Androwes’s misunderstandings, and pointed out that he had himself been
the principal sufferer by the breakdown of the enterprise, since he and
his family of ten had been illegally turned out of the rooms to which
they were entitled under the articles of agreement, and were now driven
to beg their bread. The view taken by the court is not upon record.</p>

<p>The company which was described as the King’s Revels at Norwich in 1611
and 1612 was travelling under the Queen’s Revels patent of 1610, and
was therefore clearly misnamed. But a second King’s Revels company did
in fact come into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> existence through a licence given to William Hovell,
William Perry, and Nathan May under the royal signet on 27 February
1615. It performed only in the provinces, and is traceable at Norwich,
Coventry, and Leicester. Its warrant was condemned and withdrawn by an
order of the Lord Chamberlain on 16 July 1616 (Murray, ii. 343), and
in the following year the company seems to have amalgamated with the
provincial relics of the Queen’s Revels.</p>

<p>The company is not traceable in London, but Daniel brought it to
Norwich in 1616–17. By April 1618 he had assigned his privilege
to Martin Slater, John Edmonds and Nathaniel Clay, who obtained,
presumably from the Privy Council, supplementary letters of assistance
in which they are described as ‘her Maiesties servants’, and are
authorized to play as ‘her Maiesties servants of her Royall Chamber
of Bristoll’.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> From a complaint sent in the following June by

<p>There is no trace of any grammar school in the abbey of Westminster
until the fourteenth century. The <i>Customary</i> of 1259–83 (ed. E.
M. Thompson for <i>Henry Bradshaw Soc.</i>) only contemplates education
for the novices, and in the earliest almoner’s accounts, which begin
with 1282, entries of 1317 ‘in maintaining Nigel at school for the
love of God’ (Leach, 80) and 1339–40, ‘pro scholaribus inueniendis ad
scolas’ (E. H. Pearce, <i>The Monks of Westminster Abbey</i>, 79), need
only refer to the support of scholars at a University. But from 1354–5
there were almonry boys (<i>pueri Elemosinariae</i>) under the charge
of the Sub-Almoner, and these are traceable up to the dissolution. To
them we may assign the <i>ludus</i> of the Boy Bishop on St. Nicholas’
day, mentions of which have been noted in 1369, 1388, 1413, and 1540
(<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, i. 360; Leach, 80). They had a school house
near ‘le Millebank’, and from 1367 the Almoner paid a <i>Magister
Puerorum</i>. From 1387 he is often called <i>Magister Scolarum</i>
and in the fifteenth century <i>Magister Scolarium</i>. From 1510 the
boys under the <i>Magister</i> become <i>pueri grammatici</i>, and
may be distinct from certain <i>pueri cantantes</i> for whom since
1479–80 the Almoner had paid a separate teacher of singing. The first
of these song-masters was William Cornish, doubtless of the family so
closely connected with the Chapel Royal (q.v.). In 1540 the <i>pueri
grammatici</i> were reorganized as the still existing College of St.
Peter, Westminster, which is therefore generally regarded as owing its
origin to Henry VIII, who on the surrender of the abbey in 1540 turned
it into a college of secular canons, and provided for a school of forty
scholars. This endured in some form through the reactionary reign of
Mary, whose favourite dramatist Nicholas Udall became its Head Master,
although the date of his appointment on 16 December 1555 (A. F. Leach
in <i>Encycl. Brit.</i>, s.v. Udall) makes it probable that, if he
wrote his <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i> for a school at all, it was for
Eton (q.v.) rather than Westminster. His predecessor Alexander Nowell
is said by Strype to have ‘brought in the reading of Terence for the
better learning the pure Roman style’, and, as the Sub-Almoner paid
‘xvi<i>d.</i> for wryting of a play for the chyldren’ as early as 1521
(<i>Observer</i>), the performance of Latin comedies by the boys may
have been pre-Elizabethan. It is provided for in the statutes drafted
by Dean Bill (<i>c.</i> 1560) after the restoration of her father’s
foundation by Elizabeth. These statutes also contemplate a good deal of
interrelation between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> the choir school and the grammar school. They
are printed in the <i>Report of the Cathedral Commission</i> (App. I,
80). The personnel of the foundation was to include (a) ‘<i>clerici
duodecim</i>’, of whom ‘<i>unus sit choristarum doctor</i>’, (b)
‘<i>decem pueri symphoniaci sive choristae</i>’, presumably in
continuation of the former singing boys, (c) ‘<i>praeceptores
duo ad erudiendam iuventutem</i>’, (d) ‘<i>discipuli grammatici
quadraginta</i>’. The ‘<i>praeceptores</i>’ are distinguished later in
the document as ‘<i>archididascalus</i>’ and ‘<i>hypodidascalus</i>’,
and the former is also called ‘<i>ludimagister</i>’. By c. 5 the
choristers are to have a preference in elections to the grammar school.
The following section ‘<i>De Choristis et Choristarum Magistro</i>’
forms part of c. 9:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>The following section ‘<i>De Comoediis et Ludis in Natali Domini

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>The statutes appear never to have been confirmed by the Crown, and
their practical adoption was subject to certain exceptions. Thus, it
is stated in the report of the Public Schools Commission in 1864 (i.
159) that there is no reason to believe that the provision giving a
preference to choristers in elections for the grammar school was ever
attended to.</p>

<p>Of plays and the like, however, there are various records. The first
since 1521 is at the Lord Mayor’s Day of 1561, when the Merchant
Taylors’ expenses for their pageant included items ‘to John Tayllour,
master of the Children of the late monastere of Westminster, for his
children that sung and played in the pageant’, and ‘to John Holt
momer in reward for attendance given of the children in the pageant’.
Similar payments were made to Taylor as ‘M<sup>r</sup> of the quirysters’ for
the services of the children on the Ironmongers’ pageant of 1566.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
In 1562 the choristers of Westminster Abbey performed a goodly play
before the Society of Parish Clerks after their annual dinner.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
In 1564–5 comes the first of a series of Court performances, which
received assistance from the Revels office. To this occasion belongs
a memorandum of ‘Thexpenses of twoo playes viz. Heautontimoroumenos
Terentii and Miles Gloriosus Plauti plaied by the children of the
grammer schoole in the colledge of Westminster and before the Quenes
maiestie anno 1564’.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The items include, ‘At ye rehersing before
Sir Thomas Benger for pinnes and suger candee vj<i>d.</i>’, ‘For a
lynke to bring thapparell from the reuells iiij<i>d.</i>’, ‘At the
playing of Miles Glor: in M<sup>r</sup>. Deanes howse for pinnes half a thousand
vj<i>d.</i>’, ‘Geuen to M<sup>r</sup>. Holte yeoman of the reuells x<i>s.</i>’,
‘To M<sup>r</sup>. Taylor his man’, ‘For one Plautus geven to ye Queenes maiestie
and fowre other vnto the nobilitie xj<i>s.</i>’ It is not quite
clear whether the <i>Heautontimorumenus</i>, as well as the <i>Miles
Gloriosus</i>, was given before the Queen, but I think not. In 1565–6
Elizabeth was again present at the play of <i>Sapientia Solomonis</i>,
and there were payments ‘For drawing the city and temple of Jerusalem
and paynting towers’, ‘To a woman that brawght her childe to the stadge
and there attended uppon it’, and for a copy of the play bound ‘in
vellum with the Queenes Ma<sup>tie</sup> hir armes and sylke ribben strings’,
almost certainly that still extant as <i>Addl. MS.</i> 20061 (cf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
App. K), which shows that Elizabeth was accompanied by Cecilia of
Sweden.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Whether these plays were at the school or at Court is not
quite clear. I should, on the whole, infer the latter, but no rewards
were paid for them by the Treasurer of the Chamber. John Taylor was,
however, paid for plays by the Children of Westminster during the
Shrovetide of 1566–7 and the Christmas of 1567–8; John Billingesley
for their <i>Paris and Vienna</i> on 19 February 1572; and William
Elderton for their <i>Truth, Faithfulness, and Mercy</i> on 1 January
1574. In 1567 also the boys are recorded (<i>Observer</i>) to have
played at Putney before Bishop Grindal. I suppose that Billingesley
and Elderton succeeded Taylor as <i>Magistri Choristarum</i>. Taylor
himself is probably the same who on 8 September 1557 was Master of the
singing children at the hospital of St. Mary Woolnoth. Elderton is
presumably the same who brought the Eton boys to Court in 1573. Whether
he is also the bibulous balladist of the pamphleteers (cf. ch. xv) is
more doubtful. The absence of a payment for <i>Miles Gloriosus</i> may
suggest that this was given by the grammar school who, like the Inns of
Court, did not expect a reward, and that the English plays were given
by the choristers, who were on the same footing as the choristers of
Paul’s. I am not sure, however, that the wording of the statutes quite
implies such a sharp distinction between the two sets of boys, and it
will be noticed that Taylor, or his man, was in some way concerned
with the Latin play. Very possibly grammar boys and choristers acted
together. With 1574 the Court performances end, but expenses of plays
are traceable in the college accounts in 1604–5, 1605–6, 1606–7, and
1609–10, and up to about 1640, when they stop for sixty-four years.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The King’s College of Our Lady of Eton beside Windsor was founded
by Henry VI in 1441. The Statutes of 1444 provide for a Boy Bishop
(<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, i. 365), but the custom was discontinued
before 1559–61, when William Malim prepared a <i>Consuetudinarium</i>
for a Royal Commission appointed to visit the college. By this time,
however, Christmas plays by the boys had become the practice, and Malim
writes:<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>There are ‘numerous’ entries of expenditure on these plays in the
Audit Books from 1525–6 to 1572–3, of which a few only have been
printed.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> There is also an inventory, apparently undated, of
articles in ‘M<sup>r</sup>. Scholemasters chamber’, which includes ‘a great
cheste bound about with yron to keepe the players coats in’, and a list
of the apparel, beards, and properties. The Eton boys played under
Udall before Cromwell in 1538 (<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 196, 451),
and it is possible that <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i> may belong to his
Eton mastership.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The only Court performance by Eton boys on record

<h5>viii. MERCHANT TAYLORS SCHOOL</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Head Masters</i>:&mdash;Richard Mulcaster (1561–86); Henry
Wilkinson (1586–92); Edmund Smith (1592–9); William Hayne
(1599–1625).</p>
</div>

<p>The London school of the Merchant Taylors was founded in 1561, and
its first master was Richard Mulcaster, or Moncaster, as his name
is spelt in some of the earlier records.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> He was a student of
King’s, Cambridge and Christ Church, Oxford, who had been teaching
in London since 1559. The first performances by his boys, of which
record remains, were in 1572–3. In that and the following year they
played before the Merchant Taylors Company at the Common Hall.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Unfortunately the audience, who had paid for their seats, and very
likely Mulcaster himself, paid more attention to the plays than to the
dignitaries in whose hall they were given. The plays were therefore
stopped, and the following pleasing example of civic pomposity inserted
in the archives of the Company on 16 March 1574:<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Whereas at our comon playes and suche lyke exercises whiche
be comonly exposed to be seene for money, everye lewd persone
thinketh himself (for his penny) worthye of the chiefe and most
comodious place withoute respecte of any other either for age
or estimacion in the comon weale, whiche bringeth the youthe to
such an impudente famyliaritie with theire betters that often
tymes greite contempte of maisters, parents, and magistrats
foloweth thereof, as experience of late in this our comon hall
hath sufficyently declared, where by reasone of the tumultuous
disordered persones repayringe hither to see suche playes as
by our schollers were here lately played, the Maisters of this
Worshipful Companie and their deare ffrends could not have
entertaynmente and convenyente place as they ought to have had,
by no provision beinge made, notwithstandinge the spoyle of this
howse, the charges of this Mystery, and theire juste authoritie
which did reasonably require the contrary. Therefore and ffor
the causes ffirst above saide, yt is ordeyned and decreed by
the authoritie of this presente Courte, with the assente and
consente of all the worshipfull persones aforesaide, that
henceforthe theire shall be no more plays suffered to be played
in this our Comon Hall, any use or custome heretofore to the
contrary in anywise notwithstandinge.’</p>
</div>

<p>Mulcaster, however, found more tolerant critics than his own employers.
His first appearance at Court was on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> 3 February 1573.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> On 2
February 1574 he presented <i>Timoclia at the Siege of Thebes</i> and
on 23 February <i>Percius and Anthomiris</i>; at Shrovetide 1575 and on
6 March 1576 plays unnamed; and on 12 February 1583 <i>Ariodante and
Geneuora</i>. A reminiscence of these performances has been left us by
the seventeenth-century judge, Sir James Whitelocke, who entered the
school in 1575 and left for St. John’s, Oxford, in 1588:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I was brought up at school under M<sup>r</sup> Mulcaster, in the famous
school of the Merchantaylors in London.... Yeerly he presented
sum playes to the court, in which his scholers wear only actors,
and I on among them, and by that meanes taughte them good
behaviour and audacitye.’<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In 1586 Mulcaster quarrelled with the Merchant Taylors and resigned.
In 1596 he became High Master of St. Paul’s grammar school, but it is
only conjecture that his influence counted for anything in the revival
of plays by the choir master, Edward Pearce. Regular plays at Merchant
Taylors probably ceased on his withdrawal. When Sir Robert Lee, one
of the Company, became Lord Mayor in 1602, a payment was made to Mr.
Haines, the Schoolmaster, for a wagon and the apparel of ten scholars,
who represented Apollo and the Muses in Cheapside. But when James came
to dine at the hall on 16 July 1607, it was thought best to apply for
help to Heminges of the King’s men and Nathaniel Giles of the Chapel,
on the ground that the Schoolmaster and children were not familiar with
such entertainments.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<h5>i. THE COURT INTERLUDERS</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Henry VII (22 Aug. 1485&mdash;21 Apr. 1509); Henry VIII (22 Apr.
1509&mdash;28 Jan. 1547); Edward VI (28 Jan. 1547&mdash;6 July 1553); Mary
(19 July 1553&mdash;24 July 1554); Philip and Mary (25 July 1554&mdash;17
Nov. 1558); Elizabeth (17 Nov. 1558&mdash;24 Mar. 1603).</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>doyen</i> of the Court companies, when Elizabeth came to
the throne, was the royal company of Players of Interludes. This
had already half a century of history behind it. Its beginnings
are probably traceable in the reign of Henry VII. Richard III had
entertained a company, as Duke of Gloucester, in 1482; but nothing is
known of it during his short reign from 1583 to 1585.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Nor is a
royal company discoverable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> amongst the earlier records of Henry VII
himself.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But from 1493 onwards Exchequer documents testify to the
continuous existence of a body of men under the style of <i>Lusores
Regis</i>, or in the vulgar tongue, Players of the King’s Interludes.
In 1494 there were four of them, John English, Edward May, Richard
Gibson, and John Hammond, and each had an annual fee, payable out of
the Exchequer, of £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> In 1503 there were five,
William Rutter and John Scott taking the place of Hammond, but the
total Exchequer payment to the company of £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a
year, seems to have remained unaltered to the end of the reign.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
They received, however, additional sums from time to time, as ‘rewards’
for performances, which were charged to the separate account of the
Chamber.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> In 1503, under the leadership of John English, they
attended the Princess Margaret to Edinburgh, for her wedding with
James IV of Scotland. Here they ‘did their devoir’, both on the day of
the wedding, 8 August, and on the following days. On 11 August they
played after supper, and on 13 August they played ‘a Moralite’ after
dinner.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>The royal company continued under Henry VIII, who appears to have
increased its numbers, and doubled the charge upon the Exchequer.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
The financial records are, however, a little complicated. The
Exchequer officials presumably continued to regard the establishment
as consisting of four members drawing fees of ten instead of five
marks each.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> But the individual members were in fact paid on
different scales. John English, the leader, got £6 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> Others got £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> as before, and others
again only two-thirds of this amount, £2 4<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> By this
arrangement, it was possible to maintain an actual establishment of
from eight to ten within the limits of the Exchequer allowance. It
seems also to have been found convenient to transfer the responsibility
for some at least of the payments from the Exchequer to the Treasurer
of the Chamber.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The same distinction between players of different
grades is also reflected in the annual rewards paid by the Treasurer
of the Chamber for Christmas performances. These were increased
in amount, and for a time the general reward to the players as a
whole was supplemented by an additional sum to the ‘old’ players.
Ultimately an amalgamated sum of £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> became
the customary reward for the company.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Details of a performance
of Henry Medwall’s <i>Finding of Truth</i> on 6 January 1514 are
related by Collier from a document which cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> regarded as free
from suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The name of Richard Gibson now disappears from
the notices of the company. He may, likely enough, have given up
playing on his appointment to be Porter and Yeoman Tailor of the Great
Wardrobe.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> But in his capacity of officer in charge of the Revels
he must have maintained close relations with his former fellows, and
his Account for 1510 records the delivery to John English of a ‘red
satin ladies garment, powdered, with tassels of silver of Kolen’.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
English remained at the head of the company, and is traceable in
the <i>Chamber Accounts</i> up to 1531. John Scott died in 1528–9,
in singular circumstances which are detailed by a contemporary
chronicler.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Other names which come in succession before us are
those of Richard Hole, George Maylor, George Birch, John Roll or Roo
(<i>d.</i> 1539), Thomas Sudbury or Sudborough (<i>d.</i> 1546),
Robert Hinstock, Richard Parrowe, John Slye, and John Young.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
Some interesting information is disclosed by two lawsuits, in both of
which George Maylor figured. The first of these was a dispute between
John Rastell and Henry Walton as to the dilapidations of certain
playing garments, during which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> George Mayler, merchant tailor, aged
40, and George Birch, coriar, aged 32, were called to give evidence
as to the value of the garments and their use for a royal banquet at
Greenwich in 1527.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> In the second Mayler was himself a party. He
is here described as a glazier, and an agreement of November 1528 is
recited between him and one Thomas Arthur, tailor, whom he took as an
apprentice for a year, promising to teach him to play and to obtain
him admission into the King’s company and the right to the privileges
(<i>libertatem</i>) thereof and ‘the Kinges bage’. According to Mayler,
he found Arthur meat and drink and 4<i>d.</i> a day, but after seven
weeks Arthur left him, beguiling away three of his covenant servants
upon a playing tour in the provinces, out of which they made a profit
of £30. He was, adds Mayler, ‘right harde and dull too taike any
lernynge, whereby he was nothinge meate or apte too bee in service
with the Kinges grace too maike any plaiez or interludes before his
highnes’. Arthur, on the other hand, alleged that it was Mayler who
had broken the indentures, and sued him before the sheriffs of London
for £26 damages. Owing to the accident of Mayler’s being in Ludgate
prison and unable to defend himself, the jury found against him for £4,
and he appealed to Chancery to remove the action to that court.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
The King’s men, even apart from their other occupations as Household
servants or tradesmen, were not wholly dependent on the royal bounty.
The reward at Christmas was supplemented by minor gifts from the
Princess Mary, or from lords and ladies of the Court, such as the
Duke of Rutland and the Countess of Devon;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and the glamour of
the King’s badge doubtless added to the liberality of the company’s
reception in many a monastery, country mansion, and town hall. They are
found during the reign at the priories of Thetford, Dunmow (1531–2),
and Durham (1532–3), at the house of the Lestranges at Hunstanton (23
October 1530), at New Romney (1526–7), Shrewsbury (1527, 1533, 1540),
Leicester (1531), Norwich (1533), Bristol (1535, 1536, 1537, 1541),
Cambridge (1537–8), Beverley (1540–1), and Maldon (1546–7).<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
A private performance by the King’s men forms an episode in the
Elizabethan play of <i>Sir Thomas More</i>, although the Mason there
named cannot be traced amongst their number.</p>


<p>No important change in the status of the company is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> be observed
under Edward VI. Some of the existing members seem to have retired,
and four new ones, Richard Coke, John Birch, Henry Heryot, and John
Smyth, were appointed.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The first three of these, together with
two others, Richard Skinner and Thomas Southey, received a warrant to
the Master of the Great Wardrobe on 15 February 1548, for the usual
livery assigned to yeomen officers of the household, which consisted of
three yards of red cloth, with an allowance of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
for the embroidering thereon of the royal initials.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The fees of
these five, and of George Birch and Robert Hinstock, who were survivors
from Henry VIII’s time, are traceable, as well as the annual reward
of £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, in the Chamber Accounts.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Each now
got £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year, under a warrant of 24 December
1548. The same names appear in a list of 30 September 1552, with the
exception of Robert Hinstock, whose place had probably been taken by
John Browne, appointed as from the previous Christmas by a warrant of
9 June 1552, which introduced the innovation of granting him a livery
allowance of £1 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year instead of the actual
livery.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> If we suppose that John Smith and John Young continued
to be borne on the Exchequer pay-roll, the total number of eight
interlude-players provided for in fee-lists of Edward’s reign is made
up.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> John Smith is probably to be identified with the ‘disard’ or
jester of that name who took part in George Ferrers’s Christmas gambols
of 1552–3.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> John Young may be the ‘right worshipful esquire John
Yung’ to whom William Baldwin dedicated his <i>Beware the Cat</i>
in 1553. He certainly survived into Elizabeth’s reign and was still
drawing an annuity of £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> as ‘agitator comediarum’
in 1569–70.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> I have not noticed any provincial performances by the
company during 1547–53, except at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> Maldon in 1549–50, but they are
referred to more than once in the archives of the Revels. The Revels
Office made them an oven and weapons of wood at Shrovetide 1548 and a
seven-headed dragon at Shrovetide 1549. At Christmas 1551–2 the Privy
Council gave them a warrant to borrow ‘apparell and other fornyture’
from the Master, and Lord Darcy gave John Birch and John Browne another
for garments to serve in an interlude before the King on 6 January
1552.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> William Baldwin, in his <i>Beware the Cat</i>, relates that
during the Christmas of 1552–3, they were learning ‘a play of Esop’s
Crowe, wherin the moste part of the actors were birds’.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Their only
other play of which the name is known is that of <i>Self Love</i>,
for which Sir Thomas Chaloner gave them 20s. on a Shrove Monday in
1551–3.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> </p>

<p>The company no doubt took their share in Court revels during the
earlier part of Mary’s reign. But when the eclipse of gaiety came upon
her later years they travelled. They are noted as the King and Queen’s
men in 1555–6 at Ipswich and Gloucester, in 1557 at Bristol, and in
1558 at Barnstaple, and as the Queen’s men in 1555 at Leicester, in
1555–6 at Beverley, in 1556–7 at Beverley, Oxford, Norwich and Exeter,
and in 1557–8 at Beverley, Leicester, Maldon, Dover, Lyme Regis, and
Barnstaple. The nominal establishment continued to be eight.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> But
Heriot disappears after 1552 and John Birch, Coke, and Southey after
1556, and their vacancies do not seem to have been filled.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Under Elizabeth the interlude players were certainly a moribund folk.
They were reappointed ‘during pleasure’ under a warrant of 25 December
1559, and apparently Edmund Strowdewike and William Reading took the
place of George Birch and Skinner.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> They drew their fees of £3

to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> company, not improbably for the anti-papal farce of 6 January
1559, is to be found in the Chamber Account for 1558–60. It may be
inferred that they never again played at Court. They were allowed to
dwindle away. Browne and Reading died in 1563, Strowdewike on 3 June
1568, and Smith survived in solitary dignity until 1580.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Up to
about 1573 he kept up some sort of provincial organization, doubtless
with the aid of unofficial associates, and the Queen’s players are
therefore traceable in many municipal Account-books. In October 1559
they were at Bristol and before Christmas at Leicester, in 1559–60 at
Gloucester, in 1560–1 at Barnstaple, in 1561 at Faversham,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> in
October–December 1561 at Leicester, in 1561–2 at Gloucester, Maldon,
and Beverley, in July 1562 at Grimsthorpe, and on 4 October at Ipswich,
in August 1563 at Bristol, in 1563–4 at Maldon, on 12 and 20 March 1564
at Ipswich again, and on 2 August at Leicester, in 1564–5 at Abingdon,
Maldon, and Gloucester, in 1565–6 at Maldon, Oxford, and Shrewsbury,
in July 1566 at Bristol, before 29 September at Leicester, and on 9
October at Ipswich, in July 1567 at Bristol, in 1567–8 at Oxford and
Gloucester, in 1568–9 at Abingdon, Ipswich, and Stratford-upon-Avon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in August 1569 at Bristol, and on 7 December at Oxford, in 1569–70 at
Gloucester and Maldon, before 29 September 1570 at Leicester, in 1570–1
at Winchester, and during October-December 1571 at Leicester, in 1571–2
at Oxford, on 23 May 1572 at Nottingham, and on 20 November at Maldon,
in 1572–3 at Ipswich, on 7 January 1573 at Beverley, and in 1573 at
Winchester. This list is not exhaustive.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> A reward to ‘the Queens
Majesty’s men’ in the Doncaster accounts for 1575 can hardly be assumed
to refer to actors.</p>


<h5>ii. THE EARL OF LEICESTER’S MEN</h5>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Robert Dudley; 5th s. of John, 1st Duke of Northumberland,
<i>nat.</i> 24 June 1532 or 1533; m. (1) Amy, d. of Sir John
Robsart, 4 June 1550, (2) Douglas Lady Sheffield, d. of William,
1st Lord Howard of Effingham, May 1573, (3) Lettice Countess of
Essex, d. of Sir Francis Knollys, 1578; Master of the Horse, 11
Jan. 1559; High Steward of Cambridge, 1562; Earl of Leicester,
29 Sept. 1564; Chancellor of Oxford, 31 Dec. 1564; Lord Steward,
1584–8; Absolute Governor of United Provinces, 25 Jan. 1586–12
Apr. 1588; <i>ob.</i> 4 Sept. 1588.</p>
</div>

<p>The earliest mention of Lord Robert Dudley’s players is in a letter
which he wrote in June 1559 to the Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord President
of the North, as Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire, asking licence for them
to perform in that county, in accordance with the proclamation of 16
May 1559.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The terms of the letter suggest that the company may
already have played in London, but it is probable, as nothing is said
of a hearing by the Queen, that they had not been at Court. They were
there at each Christmas from 1560–1 to 1562–3, and then not for a
decade. They were in 1558–9 at Norwich, in 1559–60 at Oxford, Saffron
Walden, and Plymouth, in July 1560 at Bristol, in October 1561 at
Grimsthorpe, in 1561–2 at Oxford, Maldon, and Ipswich, in September
1562 at Bristol, where they are called ‘Lord Dudley’s’ players, on 12
November 1563 at Leicester, and on 17 November at Ipswich, in 1563–4 at
Maldon, on 2 January 1564 at Ipswich, and on 1 July at Leicester. They
are also found, as the Earl of Leicester’s, in 1564–5 at Maldon, on 6
April 1565 at York, on 11 August 1569 at Nottingham, in January 1570 at
Bristol, on 4 May 1570 at Oxford, and in October-December at Leicester,
in 1570–1 at Abingdon, Barnstaple, and Gloucester, on 9 August 1571
at Saffron Walden,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> in October–December<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> at Leicester, in the
same year at Beverley, on 15 July 1572 at Ipswich, and on 20 August
at Nottingham. The gap in my records between 1565 and 1569 is bridged
in the fuller list covering other towns given by Mr. Murray.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Information as to the company in 1572 is derived from the signatures to
a letter asking for appointment by Leicester, not merely as liveried
retainers but as household servants, in order to meet the terms of the
proclamation of 3 January in that year.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>The names in this patent only differ from those in the letter of 1572
by the omission of Thomas Clarke. By the time of its issue Leicester’s
men were again a Court company. They had made their reappearance
at the Christmas of 1572–3 with three plays, all given before the
end of December. They continued to appear in every subsequent year
until the formation of the Queen’s men in 1583. The building of the
Theatre by James Burbadge in 1576 gave them a valuable head-quarters
in London<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>; but they are still found from time to time about the
provinces. Their detailed adventures are as follows. In 1572–3 they
were at Stratford-on-Avon, on 8 August 1573 at Beverley, on 1 September
at Nottingham, and in October at Bristol. On 26 December they played
<i>Predor and Lucia</i> at Court, on 28 December <i>Mamillia</i>, and
on 21 February 1574 <i>Philemon and Philecia</i>. In 1573–4 they were
at Oxford and Leicester, on 13 June 1574 at Maldon, on 3 December at
Canterbury. In 1574 they were also at Doncaster, where they played
in the church. For the Court they rehearsed <i>Panecia</i>, and this
was probably either their play of 26 December in which ‘my Lord of
Lesters boyes’ appeared, or that of 1 January 1575, in which there were
chimney-sweepers. From 9 to 27 July 1575 Elizabeth paid her historic
visit to Kenilworth, and there is no proof, but much probability, that
the company were called upon to take their part in her entertainment.
Its chronicler, Robert Laneham, may well have been a kinsman of the
player. I have not come across them elsewhere this year, except at
Southampton. They played at Court on 28 December 1575 and 4 March
1576, and are described in the account for their payment as ‘Burbag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
and his company’. A record of them at Ipswich in 1575–6 as ‘my Lorde
Robertes’ men is probably misdated. On 30 December 1576 they acted
<i>The Collier</i> at Court. In 1576–7 they were at Stratford-on-Avon,
in September 1577 at Newcastle, and between 13 and 19 October at
Bristol, where they gave <i>Myngo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> In 1577–8 they were also at
Bath. They were at Court on 26 December 1577 and were to have performed
again on 11 February 1578, but were displaced for Lady Essex’s men.
They may have been at Wanstead in May 1578 when Leicester entertained
Elizabeth with Sidney’s <i>The May Lady</i>. On 1 September they
were at Maldon, on 9 September at Ipswich, and on 3 November at Lord
North’s at Kirtling. They played <i>A Greek Maid</i> at Court on 4
January 1579.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Their play on 28 December 1579 fell through because
Elizabeth could not be present, but they played on 6 January 1580. In
1579–80 they were at Ipswich and Durham, and from 15 to 17 May 1580
at Kirtling. Vice-Chancellor Hatcher’s letter of 21 January 1580 to
Burghley about Oxford’s men (<i>vide infra</i>) shows that Leicester’s
had then recently been refused leave to play at Cambridge. They played
<i>Delight</i> at Court on 26 December and appeared again on 7 February
1581. That Wilson was still a member of the company in 1581 is shown
by the reference to him in the curious Latin letter written by one
of Lord Shrewsbury’s players on 25 April of that year.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> In the
following winter they did not come to Court, but on 10 February 1583
they returned with <i>Telomo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The best of Leicester’s men, including Laneham, Wilson, and Johnson,
appear to have joined the Queen’s company on its formation in
March 1583. Probably the Queen’s also took over the Theatre. James
Burbadge himself may have given up acting. Nothing more is heard of
Leicester’s men until 1584–5, when players under his name visited
Coventry, Leicester, Gloucester, and Norwich. They were at Dover in
June 1585, and at Bath as late as August. These may have been either
the relics of the old company, or a new one formed to attend the Earl
in his expedition to aid the States-General in the Low Countries.
He was appointed to the command of the English forces on 28 August,
and reached Flushing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> 10 December. The pageants in his honour
at Utrecht, Leyden, and the Hague were remarkable. Stowe records
festivities at Utrecht on St. George’s Day, 23 April 1586. These
included an after-dinner show of ‘dauncing, vauting, and tumbling, with
the forces of Hercules, which gave great delight to the strangers, for
they had not seene it before’.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It is a reasonable inference that
the performers in <i>The Forces of Hercules</i> were English.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> And
on 24 March 1586 Sir Philip Sidney, writing to Walsingham from Utrecht,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I wrote to yow a letter by Will, my lord of Lester’s jesting
plaier, enclosed in a letter to my wife, and I never had answer
thereof ... I since find that the knave deliverd the letters to
my ladi of Lester.’<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That the ‘jesting plaier’ was William Shakespeare is on the whole less
likely than that he was the famous comic actor, William Kempe; and this
theory is confirmed by a mention in an earlier letter of 12 November
1585 from Thomas Doyley at Calais to Leicester himself of ‘Mr. Kemp,
called Don Gulihelmo’, as amongst those remaining at Dunkirk.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
Leicester returned to England in November 1586. ‘Wilhelm Kempe,
instrumentist’ and his lad ‘Daniell Jonns’ were at the Danish Court at
Helsingör in August and September of the same year; and so, from 17
July to 18 September, were five ‘instrumentister och springere’ whose
names may evidently be anglicized as Thomas Stevens, George Bryan,
Thomas King, Thomas Pope, and Robert Percy (cf. ch. xiv). Some or all
of these men are evidently the company of English comedians referred to
by Thomas Heywood as commended by the Earl of Leicester to Frederick II
of Denmark. Stevens and his fellows, but not apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> Kempe, went on
to Dresden. Some of them ultimately became Lord Strange’s men. But it
seems to me very doubtful whether, as is usually suggested, they passed
direct into his service from that of Leicester.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> They did not leave
Dresden until 17 July 1587. But Leicester’s were at Exeter on 23 March
1586. They played at Court on 27 December 1586, and were in London
about 25 January 1587. They were at Abingdon, Bath, Lathom, Coventry,
Leicester, Oxford, Stratford-on-Avon, Dover, Canterbury, Marlborough,
Southampton, Exeter, Gloucester, and Norwich during 1586–7. Kempe may,
of course, have been with them on these occasions; but if Stevens and
the rest passed as Leicester’s in the Low Countries, it is likely that
they ceased to do so when they went to Denmark.</p>

<p>Finally, Leicester’s men were at Coventry, Reading, Bath, Maidstone,
Dover, Plymouth, Gloucester, York, Saffron Walden, and probably Exeter
in 1587–8.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> On 4 September they were at Norwich, and here William
Stonage, a cobbler, was committed to prison at their suit, ‘for lewd
words uttered against the ragged staff’.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> As late as 14 September
they did not yet know that the lord in whose name they wore this badge
was dead, for on that day, unless the records are again in error, they
were still playing at Ipswich.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>


<h5>iii. LORD RICH’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Richard Rich; <i>nat.</i> <i>c.</i> 1496; cr. 1st Baron Rich,

</div>

<p>The company was at Ipswich on 3 May 1564, Saffron Walden in 1563–4,
Maldon in 1564–5, York on 6 April 1565,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> and Ipswich on 31 July 1567.
Then it secured a footing in London, and appeared at Court during the
Christmas of 1567–8, on 26 December 1568, and on 5 February 1570.
On 2 February 1570 it played at the Lincoln’s Inn Candlemas ‘Post
Revels’.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> It was also at Canterbury in 1569, Saffron Walden in
1569–70, and Maldon in 1570. Presumably it was a later company to which
Gabriel Harvey referred in 1579 (cf. p. 4), and the death of Lord
Rich in 1581 might naturally have led to its disbandment or change of
service.</p>


<h5>iv. LORD ABERGAVENNY’S MEN</h5>

<p>Henry Neville, s. of George, 3rd Lord Abergavenny; succ. as 4th
Lord, 1535; <i>ob.</i> 1586.</p>

<p>The only London record of this company is a civic licence for it of 29
January 1572 (App. D, No. xxi), but it is found in provincial records
at Dover, Canterbury, Leicester, Bristol, and Faversham in 1571 and
1572, and at Ludlow in 1575–6.</p>

</div>

<p>The third Earl of Sussex had a company, which proved one of the most
long-lived of the theatrical organizations of Elizabeth’s time and held
together, now in London and now in the provinces, under no less than
three earls. It first makes its appearance at Nottingham on 16 March
1569, at Maldon in 1570, on 28 January 1571, and on 20 August 1572, at
Ipswich in 1571–2, at Canterbury and Dover in 1569 and 1570, and in
1569–70 at Bristol, Gloucester, and Ludlow, where it was of six men.
Sussex became Chamberlain in July 1572 and in the following winter
his company came to the Court, whose Christmases it helped to enliven
pretty regularly until the death of its first patron in 1583. As I have
shown elsewhere (ch. vi), Sussex seems to have had occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> deputies
in Lord Howard of Effingham and Lord Hunsdon during his term of office,
but it is probably justifiable to assume that, when the Chamberlain’s
men are referred to at any time during 1572–83, Sussex’s men are meant,
and in 1577 and 1581 there is clear evidence that the names are used
synonymously. Oddly enough, Howard’s men are also referred to in one
record of 1577 (cf. p. 134) as the Chamberlain’s, but that is probably
a slip. The detailed history of the company during this period is as
follows. In 1572–3 they were at Bath, in July 1573 at Leicester, on 14
September at Nottingham, in 1573–4 at Coventry, in 1574, on some date
before 29 September, at Leicester again, on 13 July at Maldon, and in
September at Wollaton (Francis Willoughby’s). They rehearsed two Court
plays for Christmas on 14 December, <i>Phedrastus</i> and <i>Phigon
and Lucia</i>, but in the end did not give a performance. In 1574–5
they were at Gloucester, in 1575 at Maldon, and before 29 September at
Leicester. They played at Court on 2 February 1576. Their payee was
John Adams, the only actor whose name is recorded in connexion with the
company. In 1575–6 they were at Ipswich, on 27 July 1576 at Cambridge,
and between 29 July and 5 August at Bristol, where they played <i>The
Red Knight</i>. On 2 February 1577 they played <i>The Cynocephali</i>
at Court. In 1576–7 they were at Coventry and Bath, on 30 May 1577 at
Ipswich, and on 31 August at Nottingham. On 2 February 1578 they played
at Court. In 1577–8 they were at Bath, on 15 July 1578 at Maldon, in
the same year at Bristol, and in 1578–9 at Bath. Thereafter their
activities seem to have been mainly confined to London. They were named
by the Privy Council to the Lord Mayor among the Court companies for
the Christmas of 1578–9 (App. D, No. xl), and played <i>The Cruelty
of a Stepmother</i> on 28 December 1578, <i>The Rape of the Second
Helen</i> on 6 January, and <i>Murderous Michael</i> on 3 March 1579.
In the following winter their pieces were <i>The Duke of Milan and the
Marquess of Mantua</i> on 26 December, <i>Portio and Demorantes</i>
on 2 February, and <i>Sarpedon</i> on 16 February 1580.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The
names of their Court plays on 27 December 1580 and 2 February 1581
are unfortunately not recorded. On 14 September they recur in the
provinces, at Nottingham.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> They missed the next winter at Court,
and made their last appearance there for a decade in <i>Ferrar</i> on 6
January 1583.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<p>Either the death of their patron in June 1583, or possibly the
formation of the Queen’s men in the previous March, eclipsed them, but
in 1585 they reappear as a provincial company, visiting Dover on 15
May, Bath on 22 July and in May 1586, Coventry twice in 1585–6, Ipswich
in 1586–7, York in 1587, Leicester before Michaelmas of the same year,
and Coventry in September. Here they were playing under the name of the
Countess of Sussex. In 1587–8 they were at Coventry and Bath, on 18
April 1588 at Ipswich, on 17 February 1589 at Leicester, on 1 March at
Ipswich, on 19 November at Leicester again, in the course of 1589 at
Faversham, and in 1588–9 at Aldeburgh. On 17 February 1590 they were
at Ipswich. In the spring of 1591 they appear to have made a temporary
amalgamation with a group of the Queen’s men (q.v.) and appeared with
them on 14 February at Southampton, on 24 March at Coventry, and during
1590–1 at Gloucester. This arrangement probably terminated in May, and
on 11 August Sussex’s were alone at Leicester.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>They enter the charmed London circle again with a Court performance
on 2 January 1592.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> It is possible that they had attracted the
services of Marlowe, for Kyd in a letter, probably to be dated in 1593,
speaks of himself as having been in the service of a lord for whose
players Marlowe was writing, and there are some traces of connexion
between Kyd and the house of Radcliffe. During the plague of 1593 the
company were obliged to travel again, and on 29 April the Privy Council
Register records the issue of</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">‘an open warrant for the plaiers, servantes to the Erle of
Sussex, authorysinge them to exercyse theire qualitie of
playinge comedies and tragedies in any county, cittie, towne or
corporacion not being within vij<sup>en</sup> miles of London, where the
infection is not, and in places convenient and tymes fitt.’<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The company were at Ipswich, Newcastle, and York in 1592–3. They
were at Winchester on 7 December 1593; then came to London under the
patronage of the fifth Earl, and, although not at Court, had a season
of about six weeks, beginning on 26 December and ending on 6 February,
with Henslowe, probably at the Rose. The names and dates of their
plays and sums received at each, probably by himself as owner of the
theatre, are noted by Henslowe in his diary. The company performed
on thirty nights, in twelve plays.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> Henslowe’s receipts averaged
£1 13<i>s.</i>, amounting to £3 1<i>s.</i> on the first night and
£3 10<i>s.</i> on each of the next two, and thereafter fluctuating
greatly, from a minimum of 5<i>s.</i> to a maximum of £3 8<i>s.</i>
This last was at the production of the one ‘new’ play of the season,
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, on 24 January. The enterprise was brought to
an abrupt termination by a renewed alarm of plague, and a consequent
inhibition of plays by the Privy Council on 3 February. <i>Titus
Andronicus</i> was played for the third and last time on 6 February,
and on the same day the book was entered for copyright purposes in
the Stationers’ Register. The edition published in the same year
professes to give the play as it was played by ‘the Earle of Darbie,
Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of Sussex their Servants’. I suppose
it to have passed, probably in a pre-Shakespearian version, from
Pembroke’s to Sussex’s, when the former were bankrupt in the summer
of 1593 (cf. <i>infra</i>), and to have been revised for Sussex’s by
the hand of Shakespeare. If so, it is a plausible conjecture that
certain other plays, which were once Pembroke’s and ultimately came
to the Chamberlain’s men, also passed through the hands of Sussex’s.
Such were <i>The Taming of A Shrew</i>, <i>The Contention of York and
Lancaster</i>, and perhaps the <i>Ur-Hamlet</i>, <i>1 Henry VI</i>, and
<i>Richard III</i>. There is no basis for determining whether any of
Shakespeare’s work on the York tetralogy was done for Sussex’s; but it
is worth noting that one of their productions was <i>Buckingham</i>, a
title which might fit either <i>Richard III</i> or that early version
of <i>Henry VIII</i>, the existence of which, on internal grounds,
I suspect. Of Sussex’s other plays in this season, one, <i>George a
Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield</i>, was published as theirs in 1599;
another, Marlowe’s <i>Jew of Malta</i>, probably belonged to Henslowe,
as it was acted in turn by nearly every company which he financed; and
of the rest, <i>God Speed the Plough</i>, <i>Huon of Bordeaux</i>,
<i>Richard the Confessor</i>, <i>William the Conqueror</i>, <i>Friar
Francis</i>, <i>Abraham and Lot</i>, <i>The Fair Maid of Italy</i>,
and <i>King Lud</i>, nothing is known, except for the entry of <i>God
Speed the Plough</i> in 1601 and an edifying tale related about 1608
by Thomas Heywood in connexion with an undated performance of <i>Friar
Francis</i> by the company at King’s Lynn.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>At Easter 1594 Henslowe records another very brief season of eight
nights between 1 and 9 April, during which the Queen’s and Sussex’s
men played ‘together’. This suggests to Dr. Greg that the companies
appeared on different nights, but to me rather that they combined
their forces, as they seem to have already done at Coventry in 1591.
Henslowe’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> receipts averaged £1 17<i>s.</i> The repertory included,
besides <i>The Fair Maid of Italy</i> and <i>The Jew of Malta</i>,
<i>King Leare</i>, doubtless to be identified with <i>King Leire
and his Three Daughters</i> (1605), <i>The Ranger’s Comedy</i>, and
<i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>. The latter was published in 1594
as a Queen’s play. Both it and <i>The Ranger’s Comedy</i> were played
at a later date by the Admiral’s, and may have belonged to Henslowe.
Strange’s had played <i>Friar Bacon</i> in 1592–3.</p>

<p>Thereafter Sussex’s men vanish from the annals; they may have been
absorbed in the Queen’s men for travelling purposes. Later players
under the same name are recorded at Coventry in 1602–3, Dover in
1606–7, Canterbury in 1607–8, Bristol, Norwich, and Dunwich in 1608–9,
Leicester on 31 August 1615, and Leominster in 1618, and it may be
these to whom Heywood alludes as visiting King’s Lynn. If so, their
possession of <i>Friar Francis</i> suggests some affiliation to the
earlier company.</p>


<h5>vi. SIR ROBERT LANE’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Robert Lane, of Horton, Northants; <i>nat.</i> <i>c.</i> 1528;
Kt. 2 Oct. 1553; m. (1) Catherine, d. of Sir Roger Copley, (2)
Mary, d. of John Heneage.</p>
</div>

<p>I have not come across Sir Robert Lane’s men except at Bristol in
August 1570, and at Court during the Christmas of 1571–2. On 27
December 1571 they played <i>Lady Barbara</i> and on 17 February 1572
<i>Cloridon and Radiamanta</i>. The first performance was paid for by
a warrant of 5 January to Laurence Dutton; the second by a warrant of
26 February, in which, according to the entry in the Privy Council
Register, Dutton was again named.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> But the Treasurer of the Chamber
records the payment as made to John Greaves and Thomas Goughe. Probably
this company is identical with that found next year in the service of
the Earl of Lincoln.</p>


<h5>vii. THE EARL OF LINCOLN’S (LORD CLINTON’S) MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Edward Fiennes de Clinton; s. of Thomas, 8th Lord Clinton and
Saye, <i>nat.</i> 1512; m. (1) Elizabeth Lady Talboys, d. of
Sir John Blount, 1534, (2) Ursula, d. of William Lord Stourton,
<i>c.</i> 1540, (3) Elizabeth Lady Browne, ‘the fair Geraldine,’
d. of Gerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, <i>c.</i> 1552; succ. as 9th
Baron, 1517; Lord High Admiral, 1550–3, and again 13 Feb. 1558;
1st Earl of Lincoln, 4 May 1572; ambassador to France, 1572;
Lord Steward, 1581–5; <i>ob.</i> 16 Jan. 1585.</p>


<p>Henry Fiennes de Clinton, s. of Edward and Ursula; <i>nat.</i>
<i>c.</i> 1541; m. (1) Catharine, d. of Francis, 2nd Earl of
Huntingdon, Feb. 1557,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> (2) Elizabeth, d. of Sir Richard Morison
and wid. of William Norreys, after 1579; Kt. 29 Sept. 1553;
succ. as 2nd Earl, 16 Jan. 1585; <i>ob.</i> 29 Sept. 1616.</p>
</div>

<p>Players serving the Lord Admiral were at Winchester in 1566–7. A
company under the name of the Earl of Lincoln and led by Laurence
Dutton played at Court during the Christmas of 1572–3, and a company
under that of Lord Clinton, and also led by Dutton, in <i>Herpetulus
the Blue Knight and Perobia</i> on 3 January 1574, and on 27 December
1574 and 2 January 1575. For 1574–5 they rehearsed three plays, one
of which was <i>Pretestus</i>. Probably these are the same company
transferred by the Lord Admiral to his son. Dutton was with Sir Robert
Lane’s men in 1571–2 and with the Earl of Warwick’s in 1575–6. The
whole company may have taken service with Lincoln instead of Lane as
a result of the statute of 1572 (App. D, No. xxiv), but it does not
seem to have been altogether absorbed in Warwick’s, as Lord Clinton’s
men are found at Southampton on 24 June 1577, when they were six in
number, at Bristol in July, and at Coventry in 1576–7. A later company
under the name of the Earl of Lincoln has a purely provincial record in
1599–1604. There is an isolated notice at Norwich in 1608–9.</p>


<h5>viii. THE EARL OF WARWICK’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ambrose Dudley, 3rd s. of John, 1st Duke of Northumberland;
<i>nat.</i> <i>c.</i> 1528; m. (1) Anne Whorwood, (2) Elizabeth
Talboys, <i>c.</i> 1553, (3) Anne, d. of Francis, Earl of
Bedford, 11 Nov. 1565; Master of Ordnance, 12 Apr. 1560; Earl
of Warwick, 26 Dec. 1561; Chief Butler of England, 4 May 1571;
Privy Councillor, 5 Sept. 1573; <i>ob.</i> 20 Feb. 1590.</p>
</div>

<p>Dudley seems to have had players in London in January 1562, when they
were rewarded by the Duchess of Suffolk.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> They are also found in
1559–64 at Oxford, Gloucester, Bristol, Plymouth, Winchester, Dover,
Canterbury, and Norwich. Their only Court performances upon record were
two during the Christmas of 1564–5. In 1564–5 they were apparently at
Canterbury.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>After an interval of ten years there are Warwick’s men at Court on
14 February 1575 and also at Stratford in the course of 1574–5, at
Lichfield between 27 July and 3 August during the progress,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> and
at Leicester before 29 September 1575. At the following Christmas they
gave three plays at Court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> on 26 December 1575 and 1 January and on
5 March 1576. John and Laurence Dutton and Jerome Savage were their
payees. Laurence Dutton and possibly others of the company had been, a
year before, in Lord Clinton’s service. During the next four winters
they appeared regularly at Court, and are recorded at Leicester in 1576
and Nottingham on 1 September 1577. On 26 December 1576 they played
<i>The Painter’s Daughter</i>, and on 18 February 1577 <i>The Irish
Knight</i>. The names of their plays on 28 December 1577 and 6 January
and 9 February 1578 are not preserved. They were notified by the
Privy Council to the Lord Mayor as one of the Court companies for the
Christmas of 1578–9 (App. D, No. xl), and played <i>The Three Sisters
of Mantua</i> on 26 December and <i>The Knight in the Burning Rock</i>
on 1 March. A play intended for 2 February was not performed, but
payment was made to Jerome Savage. Gabriel Harvey (cf. p. 4) mentions
them as a London company in the summer of 1579. On 1 January 1580 they
played <i>The Four Sons of Fabius</i>. A Winchester record of ‘Lord
Ambrose Dudley’s’ men in 1581–2 must be an error.</p>

<p>The Duttons were evidently a restless folk, and the disappearance of
Warwick’s men and the appearance of Oxford’s men in 1580 is to be
explained by another transfer of their services. This is referred to in
the following verses:<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The Duttons and theyr fellow-players forsakyng the Erle of

<p>In 1587–8 tumblers were at Bath under Warwick’s name. I do not
understand the entry of his men in the Ipswich accounts, as playing
on 10 March 1592. Ambrose Dudley died in 1590, and his doubtfully
legitimate nephew, Sir Robert Dudley, does not seem even to have
claimed the title until 1597. The Ipswich records are unreliable, but
possibly Lady Warwick maintained a company for a while. The Corporation
of London were considering some ‘cause’ of hers as to plays in May 1594
(App. D, No. xcviii).</p>


<h5>ix. THE EARL OF OXFORD’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John de Vere, s. of John, 15th Earl of Oxford; <i>nat.</i>
<i>c.</i> 1512; succ. as 16th Earl and Lord Great Chamberlain,
21 Mar. 1540; m. Margaret Golding, 1547; <i>ob.</i> 3 Aug. 1562.</p>

<p>Edward de Vere, s. of John, 16th Earl of Oxford; <i>nat.</i> 2
Apr. 1550; succ. as 17th Earl and Lord Great Chamberlain, 3 Aug.
1562; m. (1) Anne, d. of William Lord Burghley, Dec. 1571, (2)
Elizabeth Trentham, <i>c.</i> 1591; <i>ob.</i> 24 June 1604. Of
his daughters by (1), Elizabeth m. William Stanley, 6th Earl of
Derby, 26 Jan. 1595; Bridget m. Francis, Lord Norris; Susan m.
Sir Philip Herbert, afterwards Earl of Montgomery, 27 Dec. 1604.</p>
</div>

<p>The Earls of Oxford had their players as far back as 1492.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> A
company belonging to the 16th Earl caused a scandal by playing in
Southwark at the moment when a dirge was being sung for Henry VIII
in St. Saviour’s on 6 February 1547.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> It is probably the same
company which is traceable in 1555–6 at Dover, in 1557–8 at Ipswich, in
1559–60 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> 1560–1 at Maldon, and in 1561–2 at Barnstaple, Maldon, and
Ipswich. Murray (ii. 63) adds a few notices. There is no sign of it at
Court, and it is likely that the 17th Earl discontinued it soon after
his succession. The last notices of it are at Leicester, Plymouth, and
Ipswich in 1562–3.</p>

<p>At a later date, however, this Earl was clearly interested in things
dramatic. He took part in a Shrovetide device at Court in 1579, and is
recorded in Francis Meres’s <i>Palladis Tamia</i> (1598) to have been
himself a playwright and one of ‘the best for comedy amongst us’ (App.
C, No. lii). In 1580 the Duttons and the rest of the Earl of Warwick’s
men transferred themselves to his service, and thereby laid themselves
open to satire upon their fickleness (cf. <i>supra</i>). I do not know
whether it was their resentment at this that brought them into trouble,
but on 12 April 1580 the Lord Mayor wrote to Sir Thomas Bromley, the
Lord Chancellor, about a disorder at the Theatre two days before, which
he understood to be already before the Privy Council; and on 13 April
we find the Council committing Robert Leveson and Laurence Dutton,
servants of the Earl of Oxford, to the Marshalsea for a fray with the
Inns of Court. On 26 May the matter was referred to three judges for
examination, and on 18 July Thomas Chesson, sometime servant to the
Earl, was released on bail (App. D, Nos. xliii, xliv). These notices
suggest that the company had arranged, possibly during the absence of
Leicester’s men from town, to occupy the Theatre. In view of their
disgrace, it was no doubt better for them to travel, and on 21 June
John Hatcher, Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, wrote to Lord Oxford’s
father-in-law, Lord Burghley, to acknowledge recommendations received
from him, as well as from the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chamberlain
Sussex, that Oxford’s men should be allowed to ‘show their cunning in
several plays already practised by them before the Queen’s majesty’,
and to explain that, in view of pestilence, the need for industry
at commencement, a previous refusal to Leicester’s men, and a Privy
Council order of 1575 against assemblies in Cambridge, he had thought
it better to give them 20<i>s.</i>, and send them away unheard.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
They are traceable provincially in 1580–3.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> At Norwich (1580–1)
the payment was made to ‘the Earle of Oxenfordes lads’, and at Bristol
(Sept. 1581) there were nine boys and a man. These were probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> boys
of the Earl’s domestic chapel, travelling either with the Duttons or as
a separate company.</p>

<p>The Duttons joined the Queen’s company, John on its first establishment
in 1583. It is in the following winter, however, that an Oxford’s
company first appears at Court. Here the Earl’s ‘servauntes’ performed
on 1 January and 3 March 1584. Their payee was John Lyly, who had
probably been for some years in the Earl’s service. Provincial
performances continue during 1583–5, and in the records the company
are always described as ‘players’ or ‘men’.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> On 27 December 1584
<i>Agamemnon and Ulysses</i> was played at Court by the Earl of
Oxford’s ‘boyes’. For this the payee was Henry Evans, probably the same
who in 1600 set up the Chapel plays. I do not feel much doubt that the
companies under Lyly and Evans were the same, or that in 1583–4 they
in fact consisted of a combination of Oxford’s boys, Paul’s and the
Chapel, working under Lyly and Evans at the Blackfriars theatre.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
This arrangement had, no doubt, to be modified when Sir William More
recovered possession of the premises in the spring of 1584, and after
the performance of December 1584 Oxford perhaps ceased to maintain boy
players and contented himself with another company of his servants, who
made an appearance at Court on 1 January 1585, under John Symons, in
feats of activity and vaulting. These tumblers had apparently been Lord
Strange’s men in 1583, and by 1586 had returned into the service of the
Stanley family.</p>

<p>An Oxford’s company did not again perform at Court, but his ‘plaiers’
were at Norwich in 1585–6, and Ipswich in 1586–7,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and players
under his name were notified to Walsingham amongst others setting up
their bills in London on 25 January 1587 (App. D, No. lxxviii). They
were at York in June 1587 and Maidstone in 1589–90. Finally, at the end
of the reign, comes a letter from the Privy Council to the Lord Mayor
on 31 March 1602, which informs him that at the Earl’s suit the Queen
has tolerated a new company formed by a combination of his servants
and those of the Earl of Worcester, and that they are to play at the
Boar’s Head (App. D, No. cxxx). Oxford’s men had probably then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> been
established for some little time, as they are indicated as having
played <i>The Weakest Goeth to the Wall</i> (1600, S. R. 23 October
1600) by the title-page, and <i>The History of George Scanderbarge</i>
by the entry in the Stationers’ Register (3 July 1601). Meres’s
reference to Oxford in 1598 suggests that they may have been in
existence still earlier, as it is natural to suppose that he wrote
comedies for his own men. Some of the writers, however, with whom Meres
groups him belong to the early years of the reign, although others are
contemporary. From 1602 the company was no doubt merged in Worcester’s,
which in its turn became Queen Anne’s.</p>

<p>Walter Devereux, s. of Sir Richard Devereux and g.s. of Walter,
Lord Bourchier and 1st Viscount Hereford; <i>nat.</i> 1541;
succ. as 2nd Viscount Hereford, 1558; m. Lettice, d. of Sir
Francis Knollys, <i>c.</i> 1561; 1st Earl of Essex, 4 May 1572;
<i>ob.</i> 22 Sept. 1576.</p>

<p>Lettice, Countess of Essex, b. <i>c.</i> 1541; m. (2) Robert,
Earl of Leicester, 21 Sept. 1578, (3) Sir Christopher Blount,
July 1589; <i>ob.</i> 25 Dec. 1634.</p>

<p>Robert Devereux, s. of 1st Earl of Essex; b. 19 Nov. 1566; succ.
as 2nd Earl, 1576; m. Frances, Lady Sidney, d. of Sir Francis
Walsingham, 1590; Master of the Horse, 23 Dec. 1587; Earl
Marshal, 28 Dec. 1597; Chancellor of Cambridge University, 10
Aug. 1598; rebelled, 8 Feb. 1601; executed, 25 Feb. 1601.</p>
</div>

<p>The Bourchiers, Earls of Essex, whom the Devereux succeeded through
an heiress, had their players well back into the fifteenth century.
In fact, the earliest household troop on record is that of Henry
Bourchier, first earl of the senior creation, which is found at Maldon
in 1468–9 and at Stoke-by-Nayland on 9 January 1482.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Walter Devereux had a company, which visited Bath, Bristol, Gloucester,
and Nottingham in 1572–3, Wollaton (Francis Willoughby’s) in July
1574, Coventry on 29 August, and Leicester before 29 September 1574,
Gloucester, Dover, and Coventry in 1574–5, Coventry and Leicester in
1575–6, Nottingham in September 1576, and Bristol in September 1577.
On the Earl’s death the Countess retained the company, and under her
name it appeared at Coventry and Oxford in 1576–7. On 11 February 1578
it gave its only performance at Court, taking the place of Leicester’s
men, to whom that day had originally been assigned. It was included
in the list of Court companies sent to the Lord Mayor in December<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
1578 (App. D, No. xl), but gave no play that winter. The Privy Council
described it as the Earl of Essex’s men, and it played under that
name at Coventry in 1577–8 and at Ipswich in 1579–80; but at Oxford,
Coventry, and Stratford-on-Avon in 1578–9, and at Oxford in 1579–80,
it is still called the Countess of Essex’s. It could hardly have borne
that name after August 1579, when the Countess’s secret marriage
with Leicester was revealed to Elizabeth, and doubtless her disgrace
debarred it from any further Court favour.</p>

<p>Robert Earl of Essex had a provincial company from 1581 to 1596.
In 1581–2 it was at Exeter, in July 1584 at Ludlow, in 1583–4 at
Leicester, Stratford-on-Avon, and Ipswich, and in 1584–5 at Bath. On
26 June 1585 it played at Thorpe in Norwich, in spite of a prohibition
by the Corporation, and was sentenced to be excluded from civic reward
in future. In 1585–6 it was at Coventry and Ipswich, in 1586 before
29 September at Leicester, and possibly about May at Oxford, on 27
February 1587 at York, on 16 July at Leicester, and in the course of
the year at Stratford-on-Avon. In 1587–8 it was at Coventry, Ipswich,
Saffron Walden, and Leicester, in 1588–9 at Bath, Saffron Walden, and
Reading, on 7 September 1589 at Knowsley, on 31 October at Ipswich, and
in the same year at Faversham. It was also at Coventry and Faversham in
1589–90, at Maldon in 1590, and twice at Faversham in 1590–1, and is
last recorded at Ludlow in April 1596. Murray adds some intermediate
dates. A company of Essex’s men which appeared at Coventry in 1600–1 is
probably distinct. The execution of Essex on 25 February 1601 must have
brought it to a premature end.</p>


<h5>xi. LORD VAUX’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>William Vaux, 3rd Lord Vaux; <i>nat.</i> <i>c.</i> 1542; m. (1)
Elizabeth Beaumont, (2) Mary Tresham; <i>ob.</i> 20 Aug. 1595.</p>

<p>Edward Vaux, 4th Lord Vaux; <i>nat.</i> 1588; <i>ob.</i> 1661.</p>
</div>

<p>These companies are extremely obscure. Gabriel Harvey mentions
the first in 1579 (cf. p. 4); the second was at Leicester in
October-December 1601, Coventry in 1603–4 and 1608, and Skipton in 1609.</p>


<h5>xii. LORD BERKELEY’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Henry FitzHardinge Berkeley, Baron Berkeley; succ. 1553; m.
Catherine, d. of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey; <i>ob.</i>
1613; father of Thomas Berkeley, <i>nat.</i> 11 July 1575; m.
Elizabeth, d. of Sir G. Carey, afterwards 2nd Baron Hunsdon, 19
Feb. 1596; <i>ob.</i> 22 Nov. 1611.</p>
</div>

<p>The only London record of this company is in July 1581, when some
of them, including Arthur King and Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> Goodale, were committed
to the Counter after a brawl with Inns of Court men. Lord Berkeley
apologized to the Lord Mayor on their behalf, and said that they would
go to the country (App. D, Nos. xlix, l). Their other appearances are
all in the country, at Bristol between 6 and 12 July 1578, where they
played <i>What Mischief Worketh in the Mind of Man</i>, at Bath on
11 July 1578 and on another day in 1578–9, at Abingdon in 1579–80,
Stratford-on-Avon in 1580–1, Maldon in 1581, Stratford-on-Avon in
1582–3, Barnstaple in 1583–4, and Bath in 1586–7. Long after they, or a
later company under the same name, reappear at Coventry in 1597–8, at
Leicester in 1598 before Michaelmas, at Saffron Walden in 1598–9, and
at Coventry and elsewhere in 1603–10. Lord Berkeley’s name is sometimes
misspelt in the account-books as ‘Bartlett’.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>


<h5>xiii. QUEEN ELIZABETH’S MEN</h5>

<p>The origin of this company, the most famous of all the London companies
during the decade of the ’eighties, can be dated with an extreme
minuteness.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The Revels Accounts for 1582–3 record an expenditure
of 20s. in travelling charges by</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Edmond Tylney Esquire Master of the office being sente for
to the Courte by Letter from M<sup>r</sup>. Secreatary dated the x<sup>th</sup>
of Marche 1582. To choose out a companie of players for her
majestie.’<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The date then was 10 March 1583, and the business was in the hands
of Sir Francis Walsingham. Lord Chamberlain Sussex, to whom it would
naturally have fallen, was ill in the previous September<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and died
on the following 9 June. Walsingham’s agency in the matter is confirmed
in the account of the formation of the company inserted by Edmund Howes
in the 1615 and 1631 editions of Stowe’s <i>Annales</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Comedians and stage-players of former time were very poor
and ignorant in respect of these of this time: but being now
grown very skilful and exquisite actors for all matters, they
were entertained into the service of divers great lords: out
of which companies there were twelve of the best chosen, and,
at the request of Sir Francis Walsingham, they were sworn the
queens servants and were allowed wages and liveries as grooms
of the chamber: and until this yeare 1583,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> the queene had no
players. Among these twelve players were two rare men, viz.
Thomas Wilson, for a quicke, delicate, refined, extemporall
witt, and Richard Tarleton, for a wondrous plentifull pleasant
extemporall wit, he was the wonder of his time. He lieth buried
in Shoreditch church. [In a note] He was so beloved that men use
his picture for their signs.’<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Howes is not altogether accurate. ‘Thomas’ is obviously a mistake
for ‘Robert’ Wilson. Elizabeth had maintained players before, the
Interluders, although they had cut little figure in the dramatic
history of the reign, and the last of them had died in 1580. Dr. Greg
thinks that the players were not appointed as grooms of the Chamber, on
the ground that their names do not appear in a list of these officers
appended to a warrant of 8 November 1586.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> But Tarlton is described
as ‘ordenary grome off her majestes chamber’ in the record of his
graduation as a master of fence in 1587, and both he and his ‘fellow’,
William Johnson, are described as ‘grooms of her majesties chamber’
in his will of 1588. Their absence from Dr. Greg’s list is probably
due to their treatment as a special class of grooms of the chamber in
ordinary without fee, who were not called upon to perform the ordinary
duties of the office, such as helping to watch the palace.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
That they had liveries, which were red coats, is borne out by the
particular mention of the fact that they were not wearing them, in the
depositions concerning a very untoward event which took place in the
first few months of their service. On the afternoon of 15 June 1583
they were playing at the Red Lion in Norwich. A dispute as to payment
arose between a servant of one Mr. Wynsdon and Singer, who, in a black
doublet and with a player’s beard on, was acting as gatekeeper. Tarlton
and Bentley, who was playing the duke, came off the stage, and Bentley
broke the offender’s head with the hilt of his sword. The man fled,
pursued by Singer with an arming-sword which he took off the stage,
and by Henry Browne, a servant of Sir William Paston. Both of them
struck him, and one of the blows, but it was not certain whose, proved
mortal.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Several other places, besides Norwich, received a visit from the
Queen’s men during the first summer of their existence. In April they
were at Bristol, on 9 July at Cambridge, and between 24 July and 29
September at Leicester.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> Their travels also extended to Gloucester,
Aldeburgh, Nottingham, and Shrewsbury.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> In the winter they returned
to London, and on 26 November the Privy Council wrote to the Lord Mayor
to bespeak for them permission to play in the City and the liberties
upon week-days until Shrovetide. The City accordingly licensed them to
play at the Bull and the Bell, but with unwelcome limitations, for on
1 December it was necessary for Walsingham to write a personal letter,
explaining that it was not the intention of the Council that the
licence to play should be confined to holidays. The City record gives
the names of the twelve members of the company as Robert Wilson, John
Dutton, Richard Tarlton, John Laneham, John Bentley, Thobye Mylles,
John Towne, John Synger, Leonall Cooke, John Garland, John Adams, and
William Johnson. The company made its initial appearance at Court on 26
December, and played again on 29 December, and on 3 March 1584. Their
public performances probably continued through the spring, but in June
there were disturbances in and around the Middlesex theatres, and the
City obtained leave from the Council to suppress plays. The Queen’s
submitted to an injunction from William Fleetwood, the Recorder; and
their leader advised him to send for the owner of the Theatre, who
was Lord Hunsdon’s man, and bind him. They travelled again, and are
found in 1583–4 at Bath and Marlborough, and in October or November at
Dover. When the winter came on, they once more approached the Council
and requested a renewal of the previous year’s privilege, submitting
articles in which they pointed out that the time of their service was
drawing near, and that the season of the year was past to play at any
of the houses outside the City. They also asked for favourable letters
to the Middlesex justices. The City opposed the concession, and begged
that, if it were granted, the number and names of the Queen’s men might
be set out in the warrant, complaining that in the previous year, when
toleration was granted to this company alone, all the playing-places
were filled with men calling themselves the Queen’s players. The
records do not show whether the Council assented.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> The company
appeared four times at Court, giving <i>Phillyda and Corin</i> on 26
December, <i>Felix and Philiomena</i> on 3 January 1585, <i>Five Plays
in One</i> on 6 January, and an antic play and a comedy on 23 February.
They had prepared a fifth performance, of <i>Three Plays in One</i>,
for 21 February, but it was not called for. Mr. Fleay has conjectured
that the <i>Five Plays in One</i> and the <i>Three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> Plays in One</i>
may have been the two parts of Tarlton’s <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
The payment for this winter’s plays was made to Robert Wilson.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the company were travelling in 1585. They
were at Court again on 26 December and on 1 January and 13 February
1586. During 1586 they were at Maidstone, in July at Bristol, on 22
August and later at Faversham, and before 29 September at Leicester.
In 1585–6 they were also at Coventry. On 26 December 1586 and on 1
and 6 January and 28 February 1587 they were at Court, and in the
same January a correspondent of Walsingham’s names them amongst
other companies then playing regularly in the City (App. D, No.
lxxviii). During 1586–7 they were at Bath, Worcester, Canterbury,
and Stratford-on-Avon, whence Malone thought that they might have
enlisted Shakespeare.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> They were at Bath again on 13 July 1587,
and at Aldeburgh on 20 May and 19 July. Before 29 September they were
at Leicester, on 9 September at York, where it is recorded that they
‘cam in her Majesties lyvereys’, twice in September at Coventry, and at
Aldeburgh on 16 December. They were at Court on 26 December 1587 and on
6 January and 18 February 1588.</p>

<p>A subsidy list of 30 June 1588 shows that Tarlton, Laneham, Johnson,
Towne, Adams, Garland, John Dutton, Singer, and Cooke were then still
household players.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> It can, perhaps, hardly be assumed that the
whole of the company is here represented. Mills, Wilson, and Bentley
may have dropped out since 1583. But one would have expected to find
the name of Laurence Dutton beside that of John, as he was certainly
a Queen’s man by 1589. Knell also acted with Tarlton in <i>The Famous
Victories of Henry the Fifth</i>, and must have belonged to the
company. He also may have been dead by 1588. And this must certainly
be the case if he is the William Knell whose widow Rebecca John
Heminges married on 10 March 1588. There is some reason to suppose
that Heminges himself joined the Queen’s men, perhaps in right of his
wife. The composition of the list of 1583 generally bears out the
statement of Howes, that the Queen’s men were selected as the best
out of the companies of divers great lords, for Wilson, Laneham, and
Johnson belonged to Leicester’s in 1572, Adams to Sussex’s in 1576, and
Dutton, after a chameleon past, to Oxford’s in 1580. Mr. Fleay, who did
not know either the list of 1583 or that of 1588, declares that the
original members of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> company included James Burbadge and William
Slaughter, and probably John Perkyn.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Of these William Slaughter
is merely what the philologists would call a ‘ghost’-name, for there
is no evidence that any such actor ever existed.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Evidently James
Burbadge did not join the Queen’s men. Probably Mr. Fleay was biased by
his knowledge that these men acted at the Theatre, which was Burbadge’s
property. But this could prove nothing, as the relations between
particular companies and particular theatres were much less permanent
than Mr. Fleay is apt to suppose. The Queen’s seem to have been acting
at the Theatre when Fleetwood suppressed them in June 1584, but the
owner of the house, who can hardly be any other than James Burbadge,
is specifically described as Lord Hunsdon’s man, which of course does
not necessarily signify that he was a player at all. Moreover, it is
clear from the official correspondence of the following autumn, not
only that, as we know from other sources, the companies regularly moved
in from the suburban houses to the City inn-yards at the approach of
winter, but also that the Queen’s in particular had in the winter of
1583 dispersed themselves for their public performances over various
play-places. The view that they did not exclusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> attach themselves
to Burbadge’s, or to any other one theatre, is further borne out
by the indications in the <i>Jests</i> of Tarlton, which there is
no reason to reject, however apocryphal they may be in detail, as
evidence of the theatrical conditions under which the famous mime
appeared. The <i>Jests</i> frequently speak of Tarlton as a Queen’s
man and never mention any other company in connexion with him.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
And, as it happens, they record performances at the Curtain,<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
the Bell,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> and the Bull,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> but none at the Theatre. Nashe,
however, tells us that Tarlton made jests of Richard Harvey and his
<i>Astrological Discourse</i> of 1583 there;<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and an entry in the
Stationers’ Register makes it possible to add that shortly before
his death he appeared at the Bel Savage.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The stage-keeper in
<i>Bartholomew Fair</i> (1614), Ind. 37, gives us a reminiscence of a
scene between Tarlton and John Adams, ‘I am an Asse! I! and yet I kept
the <i>Stage</i> in Master <i>Tarletons</i> time, I thanke my starres.
Ho! and that man had liu’d to haue play’d in <i>Bartholmew Fayre</i>,
you should ha’ seene him ha’ come in, and ha’ beene coozened i’ the
Cloath-quarter, so finely! And <i>Adams</i>, the Rogue, ha’ leap’d and
caper’d vpon him, and ha’ dealt his vermine about, as though they had
cost him nothing. And then a substantiall watch to ha’ stolne in vpon
’hem, and taken ’hem away, with mistaking words, as the fashion is, in
the <i>Stage</i>-practice.’</p>

<p>Tarlton’s own talent probably ran more to ‘jigs’ and ‘themes’ than to
the legitimate drama. But the palmy days of the Queen’s company were
those that intervened between its foundation in 1583 and his death on
3 September 1588. To it belonged the men whom such an actor of the
next generation as Thomas Heywood could remember as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> giants of the
past,<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and whose reputation Edward Alleyn’s friends were ready to
back him to excel.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> From 1588 the future of the stage lay with
Alleyn and the Admiral’s men and Marlowe, and it may reasonably be
supposed that the Queen’s men were hard put to it to hold their own
against their younger rivals. Adams probably survived Tarlton, and his
name appears to be traceable as that of the clowns in <i>A Looking
Glass for London and England</i> (<i>c.</i> 1590) and <i>James IV</i>
(<i>c.</i> 1591). In 1587–8 the Queen’s visited Coventry and Exeter,
and in 1588 Dover, and on two occasions Faversham. On 19 July and 14
August they were at Bath. The Bath accounts for this year also show
a payment ‘to the quenes men that were tumblers’. Owing to Tarlton’s
death or to some other reason, the Queen’s men prolonged their travels
far into the winter. On 31 October they were at the Earl of Derby’s
house at New Park, Lancashire; on 6 November ‘certen of’ them were at
Leicester; on 10 December they were at Norwich and on 17 December at
Ipswich. But they reached the Court in time for the performance on 26
December, with which they seem to have had the prerogative of opening
the Christmas season, and appeared again on 9 February. They must have
had some share in the Martin Marprelate controversy, which raged during
1589. In the previous year, indeed, Martin was able to claim Tarlton as
an ally who had ‘taken’ Simony ‘in Don John of London’s cellar’, and
was himself accused of borrowing his ‘foolery’ from Laneham. But when
the bishops determined to meet the Puritans with literary weapons like
their own, they naturally turned to the Queen’s men amongst others.
About April 1589 <i>A Whip for an Ape</i> bids Martin’s grave opponents
to ‘let old Lanam lash him with his rimes’, and although it cannot be
assumed that, if the <i>Maygame of Martinism</i> was in fact played at
the Theatre, it was the Queen’s men who played it, <i>Martin’s Month’s
Minde</i> records in August the chafing of the Puritans at players
‘whom, saving their liveries (for indeed they are hir Majesty’s men
...) they call rogues’. Influence was brought to bear to suppress
the anti-Martinist plays. A pamphlet of October notes that <i>Vetus
Comoedia</i> has been ‘long in the country’; and this accords with
the fact that the provincial performances of the Queen’s men began at
an unusually early date in 1589. They are found at Gloucester on 19
April, at Leicester on 20 May, at Ipswich on 27 May, at Aldeburgh on
30 May, and at Norwich on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> 3 June. On 5 July they were at the Earl of
Derby’s at Lathom, and on 6 and 7 September at another house of the
Earl’s at Knowsley. On 22 September Lord Scrope wrote from Carlisle
to William Asheby, the English ambassador in Scotland, that they had
been for ten days in that town. He had heard from Roger Asheton of the
King’s desire that they should visit Scotland, and had sought them out
from ‘the furthest parte of Langkeshire’.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> One would be glad to
know whether they did in fact visit Scotland. In any case they were
back in England and at Bath by November. During 1588–9 they were also
at Reading, at Nottingham, and twice at Coventry. Both the Nottingham
records and those of Leicester furnish evidence that for travelling
purposes they divided themselves into two companies. At Leicester
the town account for 1588–9 shows ‘certen of her Maiests playars’ as
coming on 6 November, and ‘others moe of her Mayestyes playars’ as
coming on 20 May; that of Nottingham for the same year has an entry of
‘Symons and his companie, being the Quenes players’ and another of ‘the
Quenes players, the two Duttons and others’. The arrangement was of
course natural enough, seeing that even in London the Queen’s men were
sufficiently numerous to occupy more than one inn-yard. Laurence Dutton
was evidently by now a member of the company with his brother John.
It is to be presumed that Symons is the John Symons who on not less
than five occasions presented ‘activities’ at Court, in 1582–3 with
Strange’s (q.v.), in 1585 with Oxford’s, in 1586 with ‘Mr. Standleyes
boyes’, in 1587–8 with a company under his own name, and in 1588–9
either with the Admiral’s or possibly with the Queen’s itself.</p>

<p>Doubtless the incorporation of Symons into the Queen’s service explains
the appearance of the Queen’s tumblers at Bath in 1589. Performances at
Court, for which John Dutton and John Laneham received payment, took
place on 26 December 1589 and 1 March 1590. During 1589–90 the company
were at Coventry, Ludlow, Nottingham, Bridgnorth, and Faversham, on 22
April 1590 at Norwich, on 24 June under the leadership of ‘Mr. Dutton’
at Knowsley, and on 30 October at Leicester. Acrobatic feats still
formed a part of their repertory, and in these they had the assistance
of a Turkish rope-dancer.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> There were further Court performances
on 26 December and on 1, 3, and 6 January, and 14 February 1591. It is
to be noted that payment was made for the play of 1 January to ‘John
Laneham and his companye her maiesties players’ and for the rest by a
separate warrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> to ‘Lawrence Dutton and John Dutton her maiesties
players and there companye’; and that this distinction indicates some
further development of the tendency to bifurcation already observed may
be gathered from a study of the provincial records for 1590–1. On the
very day of the performance of 14 February Queen’s men were also at
Southampton, and the form of the entry indicates that they were there
playing in conjunction with the Earl of Sussex’s men. This was the case
also at Coventry on 24 March and at Gloucester during 1590–1.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> At
Ipswich during the same year there are two entries, of ‘the Quenes
players’ on 15 May 1591 and of ‘another company of the Quenes players’
on 18 May. Obviously two groups were travelling this year and one
had strengthened itself by a temporary amalgamation with Sussex’s.
Perhaps the normal combination was restored when the two groups found
themselves on the same road at the end of May, for Queen’s men are
recorded alone at Faversham on 2 June 1591, at Wirkburn on 18 August,
and at Coventry on 24 August and 20 October.</p>

<p>It was probably during this summer that Greene, having sold <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> to the Queen’s men for twenty nobles, resold it ‘when they
were in the country’ to the Admiral’s for as much more. The winter
of 1591–2 marks a clear falling-off in the position of the company
at Court, since they were only called upon to give one performance,
on 26 December, as against six assigned to Lord Strange’s men, with
whom at this date Alleyn and the Admiral’s men appear to have been
in combination. Yet it was still possible for the City, writing to
Archbishop Whitgift on 25 February 1592, to suggest that Elizabeth’s
accustomed recreation might be sufficiently served, without the need
for public plays, ‘by the privat exercise of hir Ma<sup>ts</sup> own players in
convenient place’.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> That they were again making use of the Theatre
may perhaps be inferred from a passage in Nashe’s <i>Summer’s Last Will
and Testament</i> of the following autumn, in which a Welshman is said
to ‘goe ae Theater, and heare a Queenes Fice, and he make hur laugh,
and laugh hur belly-full’.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> During 1591–2 they were at Nottingham,
Coventry, Stratfordon-Avon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> twice at Aldeburgh, and twice at Bath. In
1592 they were at Rochester, on 27 May at Norwich, before 29 September
at Leicester, and early in September at Chesterton close to Cambridge.
Here they came into conflict with the authorities of Cambridge
University, who were apprehensive of infection from the crowds
assembled at Sturbridge fair, and forbade them to play. Encouraged by
Lord North and by the constables of Chesterton, they disobeyed, set
up their bills upon the college gates, and gave their performance. It
is interesting to note that ‘one Dutton’ was ‘a principale’, and to
remember that, twelve years before, the Duttons had gone to Cambridge
as Lord Oxford’s men and had been refused permission to play by the
University authorities.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The outcome of the present encounter was
a formal protest by the Vice-Chancellor and Heads of Houses to the
Privy Council for which they requested Burghley’s support as Chancellor
of the University. After a further appeal about a year later, they
succeeded in obtaining a confirmation of their privileges.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Another
letter from the University to their Chancellor, written on 4 December
1592, is of a different character. Its object is to excuse themselves
from accepting an invitation conveyed through the Vice-Chamberlain to
present an English comedy before Elizabeth at Christmas. Sir Thomas
Heneage appears to have given it as a reason for his request ‘that her
Maiesties owne servantes, in this time of infection, may not disport
her Highnes w<sup>th</sup> theire wonted and ordinary pastimes’.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>On 11 October 1592 the Queen’s men were at Aldeburgh, on the same day
as, and conceivably in association with, Lord Morley’s men, although
the payments are distinct. They did not in fact appear at Court during
the Christmas of 1592–3, although both Lord Pembroke’s and Lord
Strange’s did. They were at Coventry and Stratford-on-Avon in the
course of 1592–3, at Leicester in June 1593 and again after Michaelmas,
at Bath on 22 August, and at York in September. On 6 January 1594 they
returned to Court and gave what proved to be their last performance
there. On 1 April they began to play at one of Henslowe’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> theatres ‘to
geather’&mdash;that is to say, either alternately or in combination&mdash;with
Sussex’s men, who had already performed there for the six weeks between
Christmas and Lent. Possibly this was a renewal of an earlier alliance
of 1591. Only eight performances are recorded, and of the five plays
given only <i>King Leire</i> can very reasonably be assigned to the
repertory of the Queen’s men. The others were <i>The Jew of Malta</i>
and <i>The Fair Maid of Italy</i>, which Sussex’s men had been playing
in the winter, Greene’s <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, which
was played for Henslowe by other companies both before and after,
and was probably his property, and <i>The Ranger’s Comedy</i>, the
performances of which were being continued by the Admiral’s men in the
following autumn, but which it is possible that they or Henslowe may
have acquired from the Queen’s. For there can be no doubt that the
Queen’s men, whether because they had ceased to be modish, or because
their finances had proved unable to stand the strain of the plague
years, were now at the end of their London career. On 8 May 1594 the
significant entry occurs in Henslowe’s diary of a loan of £15 to his
nephew Francis Henslowe ‘to lay downe for his share to the Quenes
players when they broke &amp; went into the contrey to playe’.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> This
by itself would not perhaps be conclusive, as there are other years
in which the company began its provincial wanderings as early as May.
But from the present journey there is nothing to show that they ever
returned, and it may fairly be reckoned as another sign of defeat that
while <i>The Troublesome Reign of King John</i> (1591) was the only
play certainly theirs which was printed before 1594, no less than
nine found their way into the publishers’ hands during that and the
following year. These were, besides <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>
(1594, S. R. 14 May 1594), with which they probably had only a recent
connexion, <i>A Looking Glass for London and, England</i> (1594, S. R.
5 March 1594), <i>King Leire</i> (1594, S. R. 14 May 1594), <i>James
IV</i> and <i>The Famous Victories of Henry V</i> (1598, S. R. 14 May
1594), <i>The True Tragedy of Richard III</i> (1594, S. R. 19 June
1594), <i>Selimus</i> (1594), Peele’s <i>Old Wive’s Tale</i> (1595, S.
R. 16 April 1595), and <i>Valentine and Orson</i> (S. R. 23 May 1595),
of which no copy is known to be extant. Somewhat later came <i>Sir
Clyomon and Clamydes</i> (1599).</p>

<p>The Queen’s men were at Coventry on 4 July 1594, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> Bristol in August,
and at Bath and Barnstaple, where they were unlucky enough to break
down the ceiling in the Guildhall, during 1593–4, and thereafter they
are traceable right up to the end of the reign, at Coventry, Oxford,
and Bath in 1594–5, at Leicester both before and after Michaelmas
1595, twice at Coventry and at Ludlow in 1595–6, at Stratford-on-Avon
on 16 and 17 July 1596, at Bristol in August, at Leicester between
October and December 1596, and at Faversham and Bridgnorth in the same
year, at Coventry, at Dunwich, and twice at Bath in 1596–7, at Bristol
again about Christmas 1597, at Nottingham on 8 July 1597, at Bristol
about 25 July, at Bath in 1597–8, at Leicester on 9 January 1598, at
Maldon in 1598, at Ipswich and Reading in 1598–9, at Maldon in 1599,
at Dunwich in 1599–1600, at Ipswich on 2 June 1600, and at Leicester
before 29 September in the same year, at Coventry and Bath in 1600–1,
at York in July 1602, at Leicester on 30 September 1602, at Belvoir
in August or September of the same year, and at Coventry in 1602–3.
But little, naturally enough, is known of the <i>personnel</i> of
the company during this period of its decay. On 1 June 1595 Francis
Henslowe borrowed another £9 from his uncle ‘to laye downe for his
hallfe share w<sup>th</sup> the company w<sup>ch</sup> he dothe playe w<sup>th</sup> all’,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
and I see no particular reason to suppose that this was another company
than the Queen’s. The loan is witnessed by William Smyght, George
Attewell, and Robert Nycowlles, each of whom is described as ‘player’.
It is likely enough that these were now fellows of Francis Henslowe.
Attewell had been payee for Lord Strange’s men in 1591. The earlier
loan was witnessed by John Towne, Hugh Davis, and Richard Alleyn. Davis
and Alleyn appear elsewhere in connexion with Henslowe, but Towne was
certainly a Queen’s man. He is in the 1588 list and is described as
‘one of her Majesties plears’ when on 8 July 1597 he obtained a release
of debts due to Roger Clarke of Nottingham.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> The other men of 1588
had nearly all vanished. John Singer had joined the Admiral’s by the
autumn of 1594. I should not be surprised, however, to find that John
Garland was still with the Queen’s. He was an associate of Francis
Henslowe in the Duke of Lennox’s men in 1604, and was then ‘owld’
Garland. Indeed, it seems probable that, when the Queen’s men lost
their last shred of claim to a livery on Elizabeth’s death, they made
an attempt still to hold together under the patronage of Lennox. John
Shank was once a Queen’s man.</p>

<h5>xiv. THE EARL OF ARUNDEL’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel; <i>nat. c.</i> 1511; m.
(1) Katherine, d. of Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dorset, before
1532, (2) Mary, Countess of Sussex, d. of Sir John Arundel,
after 1542; succ. Jan. 1544; Lord Chamberlain, 1544; Lord
Steward, 1553, and again 1558–64; <i>ob.</i> 24 Feb. 1580.</p>

<p>Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel, s. of Thomas Howard, 4th
Duke of Norfolk, attainted 1572, and Mary, d. and h. of 12th
Earl; <i>nat.</i> 28 June 1557; m. Anne, d. of Thomas, Lord
Dacre, 1571; succ. Feb. 1580; sent to Tower, 25 Apr. 1585, and
<i>ob.</i> there, 19 Oct. 1595.</p>
</div>

<p>The Earls of Arundel had players as far back as the fifteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The 12th Earl entertained Elizabeth with a mask at
Nonsuch on 5 August 1559. He had players, who were rewarded by the
Duchess of Suffolk, apparently during a London visit, in December
1561. The 13th Earl had a company in 1584. It was in London when plays
were suppressed in June, and obediently submitted. It seems to have
been located at the Curtain. It can be traced at Ipswich on 1 July, at
Leicester before 29 September, at Aldeburgh in 1583–4, at Norwich in
1585–6, and thereafter no more.</p>


<h5>xv. THE EARL OF HERTFORD’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Edward Seymour, s. of Edward, Protector and 1st and attainted
Duke of Somerset; <i>nat.</i> 25 May 1539; cr. Earl of Hertford,
13 Jan. 1559; m. (1) Lady Catherine Grey, d. of Henry, Duke
of Suffolk, <i>c.</i> Nov. 1560, (2) Frances, d. of William,
1st Lord Howard of Effingham, before 1582, (3) Frances, d. of
Thomas, Lord Howard of Bindon and widow of Henry Pranell, Dec.
1600; <i>ob.</i> 6 Apr. 1621.</p>
</div>

<p>These are among the most obscure of the companies. They appeared at
Canterbury in 1582, Faversham in 1586, Newcastle in October 1590,
Leicester on 22 November 1590, and Bath, Marlborough, and Southampton
in 1591–2. During the progress of 1591 Elizabeth was entertained from
20 to 24 September by the Earl at Elvetham in Hampshire ‘beeing none
of the Earles chiefe mansion houses’ (cf. ch. xxiv). This was really
a visit of reconciliation, for much of Hertford’s life had been spent
in disgrace, owing to his first marriage with the heiress, under
Henry VIII’s will, to Elizabeth’s throne. The entertainment was very
elaborate, and at its close Elizabeth protested to the Earl that it
was so honourable ‘as hereafter he should find the rewarde thereof in
her especiall favour’. No doubt Hertford’s players took a part, and
shared the ‘largesse’ which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> bestowed upon the ‘actors’ of the
pastimes before she departed. I think it must have also been their
success on this occasion which earned them their only appearance at
Court, on the following 6 January 1592. I have elsewhere tried to show
that there is a special connexion between this Elvetham entertainment
and <i>A Midsummer-Night’s Dream</i>,<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and if any special company
is satirized in Bottom and his fellows, I feel sure that it must have
been the Earl of Hertford’s and not, as Mr. Fleay thinks, the Earl of
Sussex’s.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>Probably the company went under in the plague of 1592–4, and in 1595
Hertford was again in disgrace for presuming so far upon his favour
as to claim a declaration of the validity of his first marriage. But
there were players under his name at Coventry in 1596–7, at Ipswich in
1600–1, and on 8 May 1602, at Norwich in 1601, and at Bath in 1601–2,
and this company appeared at Court on 6 January 1603. Their payee was
Martin Slater, formerly of the Admiral’s, and since then, possibly, an
associate of Laurence Fletcher in his Scottish tours. In 1604–5 they
were at Norwich. In 1606 they visited Leicester, on 9 July Oxford,
and on 2 December the Earl of Derby wrote to the Mayor of Chester to
bespeak for them the use of the town-hall. In 1606–7 they were at
Coventry.</p>


<h5>xvi. MR. EVELYN’S MEN (1588)</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>George Evelyn, of Wotton, Surrey; <i>nat.</i> 1530; <i>ob.</i>
1603.</p>
</div>

<p>Collier gives no authority for the following rather puzzling
statement:<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In Feb. 1587, the Earl of Warwick obtained a warrant for the
payment of the claim of George Evelyn of Wotton, for provisions
supplied to the Tower, and for the reward of actors on Shrove
Tuesday for a Play, the title of which is not given nor the name
of the company by which it was performed: the whole sum amounted
to only 12<i>s.</i>’</p>
</div>

<p>The date intended must be 1588, as in 1587 Shrovetide fell in March.
But there is probably some misunderstanding, as no such payment occurs
in the Treasurer of the Chamber’s accounts, and the sum named is too
small for a reward. Moreover, private gentlemen do not seem to have
entertained Court companies at so late a date. The Revels Account for
1587–8 only records seven plays. Of these the Treasurer of the Chamber
paid for six, and the seventh was presented by Gray’s Inn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>


<h5>xvii. THE EARL OF DERBY’S (LORD STRANGE’S) MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Henry Stanley, s. of Edward, 3rd Earl of Derby; <i>nat.</i>
1531; known as Lord Strange; m. Margaret, d. of Henry, 2nd Earl
of Cumberland, 7 Feb. 1555; succ. as 4th Earl, 24 Oct. 1572;
Lord Steward, 1588; <i>ob.</i> 25 Sept. 1593.</p>

<p>Ferdinando Stanley, 2nd s. of Henry, 4th Earl of Derby; <i>nat.

summoned to Parliament as Lord Strange, 28 Jan. 1589; succ. as
5th Earl of Derby, 25 Sept. 1593; <i>ob.</i> 16 Apr. 1594.</p>

<p>William Stanley, s. of Henry, 4th Earl of Derby; <i>nat.</i>
1561; succ. as 6th Earl of Derby, 16 Apr. 1594; m. Elizabeth,
d. of Edward, 17th Earl of Oxford, 26 Jan. 1595; <i>ob.</i> 29
Sept. 1642.</p>
</div>

<p>The companies connected with the great northern house of Stanley
present a history perhaps more complicated than that of any other
group, partly because it seems to have been not unusual for the heir
of the house to entertain players during his father’s lifetime. The
3rd Earl had a company in Henry the Eighth’s reign. His successor
had one as Lord Strange, which is only recorded in the provinces, in
1563–70.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Four years later he had again a company as Earl of Derby.
The earliest mention of it is at Coventry in 1573–4. It was at Dover
and Coventry in 1577–8, at Ipswich on 28 May 1578, at Nottingham on 31
August 1578, at Bristol in the same year, and at Bath in 1578–9. In the
last three months of 1579 it was at Leicester; and during the following
Christmas it made its first appearance at Court with a performance
of <i>The Soldan and the Duke of &mdash;&mdash; </i> on 14 February 1580. In
1579–80 it was at Stratford-on-Avon, Exeter, and Coventry, on 1 January
1581 at Court, in 1580–1 at Bath, Leicester, Nottingham, Exeter, and
Winchester, in 1581–2 at Nottingham, Winchester, and Abingdon, in
October to December 1582 at Leicester, and in 1582–3 at Bath, Norwich,
and Southampton. Its last appearance at Court was in <i>Love and
Fortune</i> on 30 December 1582.</p>

<p>I think that the Earl of Derby’s players must be taken to be distinct
from another company, which was performing during much the same period
of years under the name of Lord Strange. These men are found in 1576–7
at Exeter, in 1578–9 at Bath, Ipswich, Rochester, Nottingham, Coventry,
and Stratford-on-Avon. They also made their first appearance at Court
in the winter of 1579–80. Their performance was on 15 January 1580,
and they are spoken of, not as players, but as tumblers. On the other
hand they appear as players<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> at Bath, side by side with Derby’s men,
in 1580–1 and 1582–3, and as players also at Bristol, Canterbury, and
Gloucester in 1580–1, Plymouth in 1581–2, and Barnstaple in 1582–3 and
1583–4. With the tumbling at Court in 1580 begins a rather puzzling
series of records. There are further Court entries of feats of activity
by Lord Strange’s men on 28 December 1581, and of feats of activity and
tumbling on 1 January 1583. For this last occasion the payee of the
company was John Symons. Two years later Symons and his ‘fellows’ were
again at Court with feats of activity and vaulting, but they were then
under the patronage, not of Lord Strange, but of the Earl of Oxford.
There would be nothing extraordinary about such a transference of
service, were it not that during the following Christmas, on 9 January
1586, tumbling and feats of activity are ascribed to John Symons and
‘Mr. Standleyes boyes’, and that by ‘Mr. Standley’ one can hardly help
assuming either Ferdinando Stanley, Lord Strange, or some other member
of his family to be intended. This inference is confirmed by a mention
of Lord Strange’s men at Faversham in 1585–6, and it becomes necessary
to assume that, after attaching himself for a year to the Earl of
Oxford, Symons thought better of it, and returned to his original
master. Symons and his company again showed feats of activity on 28
December 1587. No patron is named on this occasion, but as Strange’s
men are traceable at Coventry during 1587–8, it is natural to assume
that they were still holding together. Now a new complication comes
in. There were activities again at Court in the winter of 1588–9, and
Symons certainly took part in them.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> But the only men companies
to whom payments were made were the Queen’s and the Admiral’s, who
now reappear at Court after absence during two winters, and it is
only in the case of the Admiral’s that the payment is specified to be
for activities. If the restless Symons had joined the Admiral’s men,
it cannot have been for long, since in the course of 1588–9 he was
leading one section of the Queen’s men to Nottingham. Nor had Strange’s
yet entirely broken up, for on 5 November 1589, both they and the
Admiral’s, evidently playing as distinct companies, were suppressed by
the Lord Mayor in the City.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Strange’s, who were then at the Cross
Keys, played contemptuously, and some of them were imprisoned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> A year
later, the Admiral’s were with Burbadge at the Theatre, and there I
conceive that the residue of Strange’s, deserted by Symons, had joined
them. If they were too many for the house, we know that the Curtain
was available as an ‘easer’. After the quarrel with Burbadge in May
1591, the two companies probably went together to the Rose. The main
evidence for such a theory is that, while the Privy Council record of
play-warrants include two for the Admiral’s men in respect of plays
and feats of activity on 27 December 1590 and 16 February 1591, the
corresponding Chamber payments are to George Ottewell on behalf of
Strange’s men.</p>

<p>This amalgamation of Strange’s and the Admiral’s, tentative perhaps
in 1588–9, and conclusive, if not in 1589–90, at any rate in 1590–1,
lasted until 1594. So far as Court records are concerned, the company
seems to have been regarded as Strange’s. But the leading actor, Edward
Alleyn, kept his personal status as the Lord Admiral’s servant, and
it is to be observed that, for whatever reason, both the Admiral’s
and Strange’s continue to appear, not only in combination, but also
separately in provincial documents.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Of this various explanations
are conceivable. One is that the municipal officials were not very
precise in their methods, and when an amalgamated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> company came before
them, sometimes entered the name of one lord, sometimes of the other,
sometimes of both. Another is that a few of the Admiral’s men may have
been left out of the amalgamation and have travelled separately under
that name. We know, of course, that Richard Jones and others went
abroad in 1592, but they may have spent some time in the provinces
first. And thirdly, it is possible that, while the combined company
performed as a whole in London, they found it more economical to
take their authorities from both lords with them, when they went to
the country in the summer, and to unite or divide their forces as
convenience prompted. I am the more inclined to this third conjecture,
in that the ‘intollerable’ charge of travelling with a great company
and the danger of ‘division and separacion’ involved were explicitly
put forward by Lord Strange’s men in a petition to the Privy Council
for leave to quit Newington Butts, where they had been commanded to
play during a long vacation, and return to their normal quarters,
doubtless at the Rose, on the Bankside. They particularly wanted to
avoid going to the country, but Newington Butts did not pay, and they
were backed by the Thames watermen, who lost custom when the Rose
was not open. It is not clear whether this petition belongs to 1591
or 1592.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The provincial records show that the company probably
travelled during 1592, but not 1591. If the petition belongs to 1592,
it is obvious that the plague intervened, and I strongly suspect that
the company’s fears proved justified, and that the reorganization for
provincial work did in fact lead to a ‘division and separacion’, by the
splitting off of some members of the combine as Pembroke’s men (q.v.).</p>

<p>This, however, anticipates a little. To Alleyn’s talent must be
attributed the remarkable success of the company in the winter of
1591–2, during which they were called upon to give six performances at
Court, on 27 and 28 December, 1 and 9 January, and 6 and 8 February, as
against one each allotted to the Queen’s, Sussex’s, and Hertford’s men.
On 19 February 1592 the company began a season with Philip Henslowe,
probably at the Rose, and played six days a week for a period of
eighteen weeks, during which they only missed Good Friday and two other
days. Henslowe records in his diary the name of the play staged at each
of the hundred and five performances, together with a sum of money
which probably represents his share of the takings.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> If so, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
average receipts were £1 14<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>; but the daily amounts
fluctuated considerably, sometimes falling to a few shillings and again
rising to twice the average on the production of a new or popular play
or during the Easter or Whitsun holiday. Twenty-three plays in all
were given, for any number of days from one to fifteen; the same play
was rarely repeated in any one week. Five of the plays are marked in
the diary with the letters <i>ne</i>, which are reasonably taken to
indicate the production of a new piece. These were ‘Harey the vj’,
probably Shakespeare’s <i>1 Henry VI</i>, <i>Titus and Vespasian</i>,
probably the play on which was based Shakespeare’s <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>, the <i>Second Part</i> of <i>Tamar Cham</i>, <i>The
Tanner of Denmark</i>, and <i>A Knack to Know a Knave</i>. The eighteen
old plays included Marlowe’s <i>Jew of Malta</i>, Greene’s <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> and <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, Greene and
Lodge’s <i>A Looking Glass for London</i>; also <i>Muly Mollocco</i>
which might be Peele’s <i>Battle of Alcazar</i>, <i>Four Plays in
One</i>, which is conjectured to be a part of Tarlton’s <i>Seven
Deadly Sins</i>, and <i>Jeronimo</i>, which is almost certainly Kyd’s
<i>Spanish Tragedy</i>. There was also a play, sometimes given on the
day before this last, under the varying titles of <i>Don Horatio</i>,
the <i>Comedy of Jeronimo</i>, or <i>The Spanish Comedy</i>, which does
not appear to have been preserved.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The same fate has befallen the
other ten plays, of which the names were <i>Sir John Mandeville</i>,
<i>Henry of Cornwall</i>, <i>Clorys and Orgasto</i>, <i>Pope Joan</i>,
<i>Machiavel</i>, <i>Bindo and Richardo</i>, <i>Zenobia</i>,
<i>Constantine</i>, <i>Jerusalem</i>, and <i>Brandimer</i>. From the
financial point of view, the greatest successes were <i>Titus and
Vespasian</i>, <i>The Jew of Malta</i>, <i>2 Tamar Cham</i>, <i>1 Henry
VI</i>, and <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>. These averaged respectively
for Henslowe £2 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for seven days, £2 3<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> for ten days, £2 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for five days, £2
0<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for fifteen days, and £1 17<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>
for thirteen days. The <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i> and perhaps also the
<i>Looking Glass</i> must have passed in some way into the hands of
Strange’s or the Admiral’s, or into Henslowe’s, from the Queen’s.</p>

<p>The performances came to an end on 23 June, for on that day the Privy
Council inhibited all plays until Michaelmas. Whether the Newington
Butts episode and the watermen’s petition followed or not, at any rate
plague intervened in the course of the summer, and the company had to
face the disadvantages of travelling. They were afoot by 13 July and
still on 19 December. Ten days later, Henslowe resumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> his account,
and the resemblance of the list of plays to that of the previous spring
renders it reasonable to suppose that the actors were the same.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
The season lasted to the end of January 1593, and a play was given on
each of the twenty-six week-days of this period. <i>Muly Mollocco</i>,
<i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, <i>A Knack to Know a Knave</i>, <i>The Jew
of Malta</i>, <i>Sir John Mandeville</i>, <i>Titus and Vespasian</i>,
<i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, <i>1 Henry VI</i>, and <i>2
Tamar Cham</i> all made their appearance again. In addition, there
were a comedy called <i>Cosmo</i>, and two new plays, <i>The Jealous
Comedy</i>, which may, I think, be <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, and
<i>The Tragedy of the Guise</i>, which is usually accepted as Marlowe’s
<i>Massacre of Paris</i>. The first representation of the former
yielded Henslowe £2 4<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, that of the latter £3
14<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>; as in the spring, his daily takings averaged £1
14<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> Besides their public performances, Strange’s men
were called upon for three plays at Court, on the evenings of 27 and 31
December 1592 and 1 January 1593.</p>

<p>The plague made a new inhibition of plays necessary on 28 January, but
it does not seem to have been for some months that Strange’s men made
up their minds to travel. A special licence issued in their favour by
the Privy Council on 6 May is registered in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Whereas it was thought meet that during the time of the
infection and continewaunce of the sicknes in the citie of
London there shold no plaies or enterludes be usd, for th’
avoiding of th’ assemblies and concourse of people in anie usual
place apointed nere the said cittie, and though the bearers
hereof, Edward Allen, servaunt to the right honorable the
Lord Highe Admiral, William Kemp, Thomas Pope, John Heminges,
Augustine Phillipes and Georg Brian, being al one companie,

places (the accustomed times of Devine praiers excepted).’<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The importance of this document is in the information which it gives
as to the composition of the company. Presumably only the leaders
are named, and of these Alleyn alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> is specially designated as an
Admiral’s man. Kempe, at any rate, and probably also Pope and Bryan,
were in Leicester’s service in the Low Countries during 1586, and all
three were together during the same year in Denmark. Whether they had
belonged, as has sometimes been supposed, to Leicester’s long-enduring
company of Court players is less certain. Pope and Bryan passed from
Denmark to Germany, and may have joined the Admiral’s or Strange’s on
their return. They also were acrobats as well as players.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Kempe,
however, seems to have parted company from the others in Denmark,
and may have joined Strange’s independently, presumably before 10
June 1592, when <i>A Knack to Know a Knave</i>, in which he played
‘merrimentes’, was produced. Heminges may possibly have been a Queen’s
man.</p>

<p>Some details of the 1593 tour and the names of two or three more
members of the company are found in the familiar correspondence of
Alleyn with his wife, whom he had married on 22 October 1592, and with
Philip Henslowe, who was her step-father.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> On 2 May he writes from
Chelmsford, and on 1 August from Bristol. Here he had received a letter
by Richard Cowley and he sends his reply by a kinsman of Thomas Pope.
At the moment of writing he is ready to play <i>Harry of Cornwall</i>.
He asks that further letters may be sent to him by the carriers to
Shrewsbury, West Chester, or York, ‘to be keptt till my Lord Stranges
players com’. He does not expect to be home until All Saints’ Day. A
reply from Henslowe and Mrs. Alleyn on 14 August is in fact addressed
to ‘Mr. Edwarde Allen on of my lorde Stranges players’. This mentions
an illness of Alleyn at Bath during which one of his fellows had had
to play his part. With these letters is one written to Mrs. Allen on
behalf of a ‘servant’ of Alleyn’s, whose name was Pige or Pyk, by the
hand of Mr. Doutone, possibly Edward Dutton, but perhaps more probably
Thomas Dowten or Downton, who was later a sharer among the Admiral’s
men. The provincial records, subject to the confusion of company
nomenclature already noted, appear to confirm the visits to Bath,
Shrewsbury, and York, to indicate others to Southampton, Leicester,
Coventry, Ipswich, and Newcastle, and to show that some temporary
alliance had been entered into with the purely provincial company of
Lord Morley.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> After 25 September 1593 Strange’s men of course
became Derby’s men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span></p>

<p>I now come to a difficult point. There exists amongst the Dulwich
papers a ‘plott’ or prompter’s abstract of a play called <i>The Second
Part of the Seven Deadly Sins</i>, which an ingenious conjecture of
Mr. Fleay has identified on internal evidence with the <i>Four Plays
in One</i> included in the Strange’s repertory of 1592.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> In this
leading parts were taken, not only by ‘Mr. Pope’, ‘Mr. Phillipps’, and
‘Mr. Brian’, but also by ‘Richard Burbadge’; lesser ones by Richard
Cowley, John Duke, Robert Pallant, John Sincler, Thomas Goodale,
William Sly, J. Holland, and three others described only as Harry,
Kitt, and Vincent; and female parts by Saunder, Nick, Robert, Ned,
Will, and T. Belt, who may be presumed to have been boys.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Alleyn,
Kempe, and Heminges are not named, but there are several parts to which
no actors are assigned. What, however, is the date of the ‘plott’? Not
necessarily 1592, for the performance of <i>Four Plays in One</i> in
that year was only a revival. The authorship of the <i>Seven Deadly
Sins</i> is ascribed to Tarlton, and therefore the original owners were
probably the Queen’s men. They are not very likely to have parted with
it before Tarlton’s death in 1588 brought the first shock to their
fortunes, but clearly it may have come into the possession of Strange’s
or the Admiral’s or the combined company before ever they reached the
Rose. And surely the appearance of Richard Burbadge suggests that the
‘plott’ was brought from the Theatre, and represents a performance
there. He is very unlikely to have joined at the Rose the company which
had just been driven there by a quarrel with his father. It is true
that in the ‘plott’ of <i>Dead Man’s Fortune</i>, which also probably
dates from the sojourn of the Admiral’s (q.v.) at the Theatre, he was
apparently not playing leading parts but only a messenger. But the
wording is obscure, and after all the absence of the prefix ‘Mr.’ from
his name in the ‘plott’ of the <i>Sins</i> may indicate, in accordance
with the ordinary usage of the Dulwich documents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> that he was not
yet a sharer when it was drawn up. Apparently, then, at least four
of Strange’s men, as we find them in 1593, besides Alleyn, had been
playing at the Theatre about 1590–1. These were Pope, Phillips, Bryan,
and Cowley. Obviously we cannot say whether it was to the original
Admiral’s or the original Strange’s that they belonged. One other point
of <i>personnel</i> must not be overlooked. Shakespeare contributed to
the repertory of Strange’s in 1592 and perhaps also in 1593. Greene
calls him a Shake-scene, but neither the ‘plott’ of 1590, nor the
licence of 1593, nor the Alleyn correspondence of the same year, yields
his name.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>Derby’s men did not appear at Court during the winter of 1593–4. On 16
April 1594 Lord Derby died. On 16 May the company used the Countess’s
name at Winchester. It seems clear that during the summer there was
some reshuffling of the companies, that Alleyn took the leadership of
a new body of Admiral’s men, that several other members of the old
combination, including Pope, Heminges, Kempe, and Phillips, joined
with Burbadge, Shakespeare, and Sly, under the patronage of the Lord
Chamberlain, Henry Lord Hunsdon, and that, after a short period of
co-operation with each other and Henslowe, the two companies definitely
parted. In the course of 1594 the name of Derby’s men appeared upon the
title-page of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, probably because they had played
it in its earlier form of <i>Titus and Vespasian</i> in 1592–3, before
it passed to Pembroke’s and from them to Sussex’s. In the same year
was published <i>A Knack to Know a Knave</i> (S. R. 7 January 1594) as
played ‘by Ed. Allen and his companie’ and with ‘merrimentes’ by Kemp.
This also belongs to the 1592–3 repertory, of the other plays in which
<i>1 Henry VI</i>, like <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, passed ultimately to
the Chamberlain’s men, and a considerable number, either as their own
property or that of Henslowe, to the Admiral’s. These included <i>Tamar
Cham</i>, <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>,
<i>The Jew of Malta</i>, <i>The Massacre of Paris</i>, <i>Friar Bacon
and Friar Bungay</i>, and probably <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, of Orlando’s
part in which a transcript, with alterations in Alleyn’s hand, is
preserved at Dulwich.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> The only play not named in Henslowe’s diary
which can be traced to the company is <i>Fair Em</i>, which bears the
name of Lord Strange’s men on its title-page, but of which the first
edition is undated.</p>

<p>It is possible that those of the fifth Earl of Derby’s men who did not
take service with the Lord Chamberlain, passed into a provincial period
of existence under his successor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> the sixth Earl. A company bearing
his name was at Norwich on 15 September 1594, at Dunwich in 1594–5
and 1595–6, at Coventry, Bath, and Stratford in 1595–6, at Leicester
between October and December 1596, at Bath in 1596–7, at Maldon in
1597, at Coventry twice in 1597–8, at Leicester in 1597–8, and between
October and December 1598, at Wollaton (Percival Willoughby’s) on 7
October 1599, and at Leicester again on 16 October 1599. Letters of 30
June 1599 relate that the Earl of Derby was then ‘busy penning comedies
for the common players’, and it is perhaps natural to suppose that his
own company were chosen as the exponents of his art.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> This perhaps
explains its appearance at Court during the winters of 1599–1600 and
1600–1. Four performances were given, on 3 and 5 February 1600 and 1
and 6 January 1601, and for these Robert Browne, who had been both
with Worcester’s men and the Admiral’s, but much of whose dramatic
career had been spent in Germany, was the payee. In an undated letter
to Sir Robert Cecil, Lady Derby writes, ‘Being importuned by my Lord
to intreat your favor that his man Browne, with his companye, may not
be bared from ther accoustomed plaing, in maintenance wherof they have
consumde the better part of ther substance, if so vaine a matter shall
not seame troublesum to you, I could desier that your furderance might
be a meane to uphold them, for that my Lord taking delite in them, it
will kepe him from moer prodigall courses’.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> To this company are
doubtless to be assigned <i>Edward IV</i>, perhaps by Heywood (1600, S.
R. 28 August 1599), and the anonymous <i>Trial of Chivalry</i> (1605,
S. R. 4 December 1604), both of which are credited to Derby’s men on
their title-pages. It again becomes provincial and is traceable at
Norwich on 27 February and 9 June 1602, at Ipswich on 4 June 1602, and
thereafter up to 1618, chiefly at Coventry and at Gawthorpe Hall, the
house of Derby’s neighbours, the Shuttleworths.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>John Taylor, the water-poet, returned from his journey to Scotland in
1618 at the Maidenhead Inn, Islington, and here after supper on 14
October ‘we had a play of the Life and Death of Guy of Warwick, played
by the Right Honourable the Earl of Derby his men’. Presumably this
was Day and Dekker’s play entered on the Stationers’ Register in 1619,
which Mr. Bullen declines to identify with the <i>Guy of Warwick</i>
published as ‘by B. J.’ in 1661.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<h5>xviii. THE EARL OF PEMBROKE’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;Halliwell-Phillipps collected
provincial records and other notes on Pembroke’s men in <i>A
Budget of Notes and Memoranda</i> (1880). The Bill, Answer, and
Replication in Shaw <i>et al.</i> v. Langley (1597–8, Court of
Requests) are in C. W. Wallace, <i>The Swan Theatre and the Earl
of Pembroke’s Servants</i> (1911, <i>E. S.</i> xliii. 340).]</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is an isolated record of a Pembroke’s company at Canterbury in
1575–6, hardly to be regarded as continuous with that which makes its
appearance in the last decade of the century. Fleay, 87, puts the
origin of the latter in 1589, and supposes it to be a continuation
of Worcester’s men after the death of their original patron in 1589,
and to be the company ridiculed by Nashe (iii. 324) for playing
<i>Delphrigus</i> and <i>The King of the Fairies</i>, in his preface to
Greene’s <i>Menaphon</i> (1589). But this Worcester’s company is not
in fact traceable during 1585–9, and Fleay’s theory is only based on
the allusion to <i>Hamlet</i> in the same preface (iii. 315), and the
assumption that the <i>Ur-Hamlet</i>, like some other plays, passed
to the Chamberlain’s from Pembroke’s, whereas it may just as well
have passed to them from Strange’s. As a matter of fact, there is no
mention of Pembroke’s before 1592 and no reason to suppose that it had
an earlier existence. It will be well to detail the few facts of its
history before attempting anything in the nature of conjecture. It
was at Leicester in the last three months of 1592 and made its only
appearances at Court on 26 December 1592 and 6 January 1593. In the
following summer it travelled, and is found at York in June, at Rye in
July, and in 1592–3 at Ludlow, Shrewsbury, Coventry, Bath, and Ipswich.
But it had little success. Henslowe wrote to Alleyn on 28 September,
‘As for my lorde a Penbrockes w<sup>ch</sup> you desier to knowe wheare they
be they ar all at home and hausse ben this v or sixe weackes for they
cane not saue ther carges w<sup>th</sup> trauell as I heare &amp; weare fayne
to pane ther parell for ther carge’.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> About the same time three
of their plays came to the booksellers’ hands. These were Marlowe’s
<i>Edward the Second</i> (1594, S. R. 6 July 1593), <i>The Taming of A
Shrew</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> (1594, S. R. 2 May 1594), and <i>The True Tragedy of Richard
Duke of York</i> (1595). Probably the play to which this last is a
sequel, <i>1 Contention of York and Lancaster</i> (1594, S. R. 12 March
1594) was also theirs, although the name of the company is not on the
title-page. It is on the title-page of <i>Titus Andronicus</i> (1594),
and its position suggests that the play passed to them from Strange’s
and from them before publication to Sussex’s. All these plays, with
the exception of <i>Edward II</i>, seem to have been worked upon by
Shakespeare, and probably they ultimately became part of the stock of
the Chamberlain’s men. These men were playing <i>Titus Andronicus</i>
and <i>The Taming of The Shrew</i> in June 1594, and that they also
owned <i>The Contention</i> in its revised form of <i>2, 3 Henry VI</i>
is suggested both by its inclusion in the First Folio and by the
reference in the Epilogue to <i>Henry V</i> not only to the loss of
France but also to the bleeding of England ‘which oft our stage hath
shown’.</p>

<p>I now enter a region of conjecture. It seems to me, on the whole,
likely that the origin of Pembroke’s men is to be explained by the
special conditions of the plague-years 1592–3, and was due to a
division for travelling purposes of the large London company formed
by the amalgamation of Strange’s and the Admiral’s. Such a division
had been foreshadowed as likely to be necessary in the petition sent
by Strange’s men to the Privy Council during the summer of 1592 or
earlier, and may actually have become necessary when, after all, the
plague rendered travelling imperative. If this suggestion is well
founded, it becomes not difficult to explain some of the transferences
of acting rights in certain plays which seem to have taken place. Thus
Strange’s may have handed over <i>Titus Andronicus</i> in its earlier
form of <i>Titus and Vespasian</i> to Pembroke’s for the travels of
1593, and may also have handed over <i>The Contention of York and
Lancaster</i>, if that was originally theirs, as is suggested by their
production of <i>1 Henry VI</i>, which belongs to the same closely
related series. This opens up a more important line of speculation.
It is usual to assume that one of the members of Strange’s from 1592
or earlier until its reconstitution as the Chamberlain’s in 1594 was
William Shakespeare, and there is no reason to doubt his authorship
at any rate of the Talbot scenes, which we know from Nashe to have
been staged as part of <i>1 Henry VI</i> in 1592. At the same time,
the names of at least seventeen of Strange’s and the Admiral’s men
in 1590–3 are otherwise known, and his is not one of them, and in
particular his prominence amongst the Chamberlain’s men from the very
beginning renders it extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> unlikely that, if he had been a member
of the company in 1593, he would not have been mentioned in the Privy
Council warrant of 6 May. Further, it seems to me impossible to resist
the inference that the attribution to him of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>
both by Francis Meres in 1598 and in the First Folio of 1623 can
only be explained by his revision under that name of <i>Titus and
Vespasian</i>, and that this was for the second production of the
play as ‘ne’ for Henslowe by Sussex’s men on 24 January 1594. There
is, therefore, really some basis for the suggestion made long ago by
Halliwell-Phillipps that he is to be looked for during these years
in Pembroke’s company until its collapse and then in Sussex’s, and
that it was from this rather than directly from Strange’s that he
went to the Chamberlain’s.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> On the other hand, it may be that for
a time he was not attached as an actor to any company at all. It is
possible that he took advantage of the plague-interval to travel in
Italy and only resumed the regular exercise of his profession when
the Chamberlain’s company was formed. In any event, it must have been
he who revised <i>The Contention</i> as <i>2, 3 Henry VI</i>, and the
close stylistic relation of these plays to <i>1 Henry VI</i> makes
it probable that the work on all three belongs to about the same
date. The limitations of conjecture on so intricate a question are
obvious, but I can conceive the order of events as being somewhat as
follows. Shakespeare’s first dramatic job, which earned him the ill
will of Greene, was the writing or re-writing of <i>1 Henry VI</i> for
Strange’s, in the early spring of 1592. During the winter of 1592–3 he
revised <i>The Contention</i> for Pembroke’s and completed the series
of his early histories with <i>Richard III</i>, and, as I am inclined
to suspect, also an <i>Ur-Henry VIII</i>. He also wrote <i>The Jealous
Comedy</i> or <i>Comedy of Errors</i> for Strange’s. In the summer
of 1593 Sussex’s took over the plays of the bankrupt Pembroke’s,
including the Shakespearian histories <i>Titus and Vespasian</i> and
<i>The Taming of A Shrew</i>. Some at least of these Pembroke’s had
themselves derived in 1592 or 1593 from Strange’s. During the winter of
1593–4 Sussex’s played either <i>Richard III</i> or <i>Henry VIII</i>
as <i>Buckingham</i>, and also <i>Titus and Vespasian</i> revised
for them by Shakespeare as <i>Titus Andronicus</i>. Alarmed at the
further inhibition of plays in February, they allowed the revised
<i>Titus</i> and unrevised texts of <i>The Taming of A Shrew</i> and
<i>The Contention</i> to get into the hands of the booksellers. Whether
Shakespeare had already revised <i>A Shrew</i> or did so later for the
Chamberlain’s (q.v.) I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> uncertain. Finally, by the transfer of their
plays to the Chamberlain’s men, who at once revived <i>A Shrew</i> and
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and by the incorporation of Strange’s men in
the same company, the original stock of Strange’s plays, as distinct
from the Admiral’s, came together in the same hands once more. On the
assumption that Shakespeare never left Strange’s, it is difficult to
explain either the fortunes of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, or the absence
from the lists of Strange’s plays in Henslowe’s diary of <i>Richard
III</i>, which must have been written about 1592–4. The silence as
regards Strange’s both of the Court records and of Henslowe’s diary
during the winter of 1593–4 makes it unlikely that they were in London,
and they would surely not produce a new play in the country.</p>

<p>Nothing further is heard of a Pembroke’s company for three or four
years.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> But in 1597 one appeared in London about which we have
rather full information, recently increased by Mr. Wallace’s discovery
of a Court of Requests suit in which they were concerned. Towards
the end of February in that year Robert Shaw, Richard Jones, Gabriel
Spencer, William Bird <i>alias</i> Borne, and Thomas Downton, who
describe themselves in a suit of the following November as Pembroke’s
servants, together with others their ‘accomplices and associates’,
entered into an agreement with Francis Langley to play for twelve
months ending on 20 February 1598 at the Swan. Each man gave a bond of
£100, which was apparently to safeguard Langley against any failure by
the company as a whole or of Robert Shaw or a sufficient substitute in
particular to perform during this period, or against any performance
elsewhere, otherwise than ‘in private places’, within five miles of
London. Langley found £300 for apparel and, as he claimed, making ready
of the play-house, and was to receive a moiety of the takings of the
galleries and to be repaid for the apparel out of the other moiety.
Of the men concerned, Jones and Downton had been Admiral’s men during
1594–7, and their transference coincides with a three weeks’ break in
the performances of the Admiral’s at the Rose from 12 February onwards.
Mr. Wallace (<i>E. S.</i> xliii. 357) says that Shaw, Spencer, and
Bird were also of the Admiral’s, but of this there is no evidence. If
Pembroke’s had any continued life during 1594–7, they may have shared
it. But this seems improbable, and on the whole I am inclined to think
that they came from the Chamberlain’s (q.v.). Plays were given at the
Swan for some months, and Langley took £100 from the galleries, and
£100 more for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> apparel. Then came an inhibition of plays near London on
28 July 1597, caused by the production of <i>The Isle of Dogs</i>, as a
result of which one of the authors, Nashe, fled, and the other, Jonson,
together with Shaw and Spencer, was committed to the Marshalsea. The
definite evidence that Shaw and Spencer were Pembroke’s men at the
Swan, now produced by Mr. Wallace, confirms my conjecture (<i>M. L.
R.</i> iv. 411, 511) that <i>The Isle of Dogs</i> was an adventure
of that house and not, as has sometimes been thought, of the Rose.
Either in anticipation of a prolonged closing of the house or for some
other reason, the company now desired to shake off their relations
with Langley. Early in August Jones returned to Henslowe and made a
new covenant with him. His example was followed by Shaw, Spencer, and
Bird, and early in October by Downton. Their prescience was justified,
for when in the course of October the chief offenders were released,
and the inhibition, which was nominally terminable on 1 November, was
in practice relaxed, it proved that, while Henslowe was able to get
a new licence for the Rose, Langley could get none for the Swan. He
urged them to try their fortunes without a licence, as others of their
company were willing to do, but they not unnaturally refused, and
Henslowe (i. 54) records, ‘The xj of October begane my lord Admerals
and my lord of Penbrockes men to playe at my howsse 1597’. He describes
the company under the double name again on 21 and 23 October and 5
November, but on 1 December and thereafter as the Lord Admiral’s
(i. 68–70). A study of the Admiral’s repertory for 1597–8 suggests
that some or all of the plays <i>Black Joan</i>, <i>Hardicanute</i>,
<i>Bourbon</i>, <i>Sturgflattery</i>, <i>Branholt</i>, <i>Friar
Spendleton</i>, <i>Alice Pierce</i>, and <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> may
have been brought in by Pembroke’s men.</p>

<p>The five seceders had not heard the last of Langley. He sued them
at common law on the bonds given not to play in a rival house. They
successfully applied to have the case transferred to the Court of
Requests, and in the course of the pleadings maintained, firstly, that
they were prevented from playing at the Swan by the restraint and
Langley’s failure to get a licence; secondly, that Langley had orally
assented to their transfer to Henslowe; thirdly, that they could not
appear at the Swan as a company, since Langley had ‘procured from
them’ two (or, as they afterwards said, three) of their associates,
to whom he had returned their obligations; and fourthly, that Langley
had suffered no damage, since other men were occupying his house.
They also complained that Langley had never handed over the apparel
for which they had recouped him out of their gallery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> takings. The
negotiations with Langley which they describe seem to have taken place
during October. About the covenants entered into with Henslowe as far
back as the beginning of August they said nothing, and whether either
Langley or the court ever found out about these, and what the ultimate
decision of the court on the main issue was, must remain uncertain.
But certain loans entered in Henslowe’s diary suggest that in March
1598 Langley was in a position to arrest Bird, and that in September
of the same year some kind of agreement was arrived at, under which
Langley received £35, as well as £19 or more for a rich cloak (i. 63,
72, 73, 95, 96). It is possible that a ‘sewt agenste Thomas Poope’ of
the Chamberlain’s, for which Henslowe (i. 72) made a personal advance
of 10<i>s.</i> to William Bird on 30 August 1598, may also have been
connected with the shiftings of companies in 1597.</p>

<p>The names of the two or three members of the company to whom Langley
gave back their bonds are not stated in the pleadings. Perhaps one
was Jonson, and the other two might conceivably have been Humphrey
and Anthony Jeffes, since the name of ‘Humfrey’ stands with that of
‘Gabriel’ in stage-directions to <i>3 Henry VI</i>, and Henslowe’s
list of the reconstituted Admiral’s company as it stood in October
1597–January 1598 contains ‘the ij Geffes’, who are not traceable in
the 1594–7 company and may well have come in with the five Pembroke’s
men. Langley tells us that certain ‘fellows’ of his opponents had
taken a more reasonable line than theirs and returned to the Swan.
How long these men remained there we do not know, but probably they
secured Pembroke’s patronage after the five had been definitely merged
in the Admiral’s, for by the end of 1597 there was clearly a distinct
Pembroke’s company again. Provincial records yield the name, not only
at Bath in 1596–7 and at Bristol in September 1597, which may point to
a tour of the undivided Swan company during the period of restraint,
but also at Bath in 1598–9, at Bristol in July 1598, at Leicester
between October and December, at Dover on 7 October, at Coventry on
12 December, and at Bewdley on 22 December. They were at Norwich in
April 1599, at Coventry on 4 July, and at Bristol in July. They were
at York on 21 January 1600, Bristol in April, Marlborough in May, and
Leicester before Michaelmas. In October they were in relationship
with Henslowe, who notes ‘my Lordes of Penbrockes men begane to playe
at the Rosse’, and records performances of <i>Like Unto Like</i> and
<i>Roderick</i> on 28 and 29 October respectively.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
brought him 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and the latter 5<i>s.</i>, and there
apparently the experiment ended, and with it, so far as is known, the
career of Pembroke’s men. It is just possible that they were merged
in Worcester’s company, which arose shortly afterwards. Mr. Fleay
expands this possibility into a definite theory that Kempe, Beeston,
Duke, and Pallant left the Chamberlain’s men for Pembroke’s in 1599,
and ultimately passed from these to Worcester’s. This is improbable as
regards Kempe, and unproved as regards the rest.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>It was perhaps his employment as deputy to the Earl of Sussex in the
office of Lord Chamberlain which led Lord Howard to encourage players.
A company, under the name of Lord Howard’s men, appeared at Court for
the first time at the Christmas of 1576–7. On 27 December they played
<i>Tooley</i>, and on 17 February <i>The Solitary Knight</i>.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> They
came again for the last time in the following winter, and performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> on
5 January 1578. They were also at Kirtling on 3 December 1577, Saffron
Walden in 1577–8, Ipswich on 24 October 1577, in 1578–9, and perhaps on
8 October 1581, Bristol, where they gave <i>The Queen of Ethiopia</i>,
between 31 August and 6 September 1578, Nottingham on 19 December 1578,
and Bath and Coventry in 1578–9.</p>

<p>Howard again had players at Court, after he became Admiral in 1585.
The first record of them is at Dover in June 1585. Later in the year
they were playing in conjunction with the Lord Chamberlain’s (Lord
Hunsdon’s). ‘The Lorde Chamberlens and the Lord Admirall’s players’
were rewarded at Leicester in October-December 1585, and ‘the servants
of the lo: admirall and the lo: Chamberlaine’ for a play at Court on 6
January 1586.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> During the same Christmas, however, the Admiral’s
played alone on 27 December 1585, and as Hunsdon’s survived in the
provinces, the two organizations may have been amalgamated for one
performance only. The Admiral’s were at Coventry, Faversham, Ipswich,
and Leicester in 1585–6. They were reported to Walsingham amongst other
London companies on 25 January 1587 (App. D, No. lxxviii), although
they did not appear at Court during this winter. In 1586–7 they were at
Cambridge, Coventry, Bath, York, Norwich, Ipswich, Exeter, Southampton,
and Leicester. By November they were back in London, and on the 16th
an accident at their theatre is thus related by Philip Gawdy to his
father:<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Possibly the company went into retirement as a result of this disaster;
at any rate nothing more is heard of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> until the Christmas of
1588–9. They then came to Court, and were rewarded for two interludes
and ‘for showinge other feates of activitye and tumblinge’ on 29
December 1588 and 11 February 1589.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> On 6 November 1589 they were
playing in the City, and were suppressed by the Lord Mayor, because
Tilney, the Master of the Revels, misliked their plays. Probably
they had been concerning themselves with the Marprelate controversy.
Strange’s men, who were evidently performing as a separate company,
shared their fate. It may have been this misadventure which led the
Admiral’s to seek house-room with James Burbadge at the Theatre (q.v.),
where some evidence by John Alleyn, who, with James Tunstall, was of
their number, locates them in November 1590 and May 1591. A relic of
this period may be presumed to exist in the ‘plot’ of <i>Dead Man’s
Fortune</i>, preserved with other plots belonging to the company at
Dulwich, in which Burbadge, doubtless Richard Burbadge, then still a
boy, appeared. Certainly there is nothing to connect Burbadge with
the company at any other date. Other actors in the piece were one
Darlowe, ‘b[oy?] Samme’, and Robert Lee, later of Anne’s men. The
Admiral’s again showed ‘feats of activitie’ at Court on 28 December
1589, and a play on 3 March 1590. In 1589–90 they were at Coventry,
Ipswich, Maidstone, Marlborough, Winchester, and Gloucester, and in
1590–1 at Winchester and Gloucester. Marlowe’s <i>Tamburlaine</i> was
published in 1590 as ‘shewed upon stages in the City of London’ by
the Admiral’s men. The Court records for the following winter present
what looks at first sight like a curious discrepancy. The accounts of
the Treasurer of the Chamber include payments for plays and activities
on 27 December 1590 and 16 February 1591 to Lord Strange’s men. The
corresponding warrants, however, were made out, according to the
Privy Council Register, for the Admiral’s. Probably there is no error
here, and the entries are evidence of an amalgamation between the two
companies, which possibly dated from as far back as the winter of 1589,
and which seems to have endured until the summer of 1594. Technically,
it would seem that it was the Admiral’s who were merged in Strange’s
men. It is the latter and not the former who generally appear in
official documents during this period. I have therefore dealt with
its details for both companies, with the question of the precise date
of the amalgamation, and with the possibility that the plot of <i>The
Seven Deadly Sins</i> and its list of actors also belong to a Theatre
performance of about 1590, in my account of Strange’s men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> and need
only remark here that the name of the Admiral’s does not altogether
fall into disuse, especially in provincial records, and that the
leading actor, Edward Alleyn, in particular, is shown by an official
document to have retained his personal status as an Admiral’s servant.</p>

<p>It is a question of some interest how early Alleyn’s connexion with
the Admiral’s may be supposed to have begun. Was he, for example, the
original Tamburlaine of 1587, and was it as an Admiral’s man that
Nashe referred to him, if it was he to whom Nashe referred, as the
Roscius of the contemporary players in his <i>Menaphon</i> epistle
of 1589? He is known to have been a member of Worcester’s company in
1583. Dr. Greg is disposed to think that he remained with them until
the death of the third Earl of Worcester on 22 February 1589, and
then joined the Admiral’s.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> It is, however, to be observed that
there is no trace of Worcester’s men between 1584 and 1590, and that
it is in 1585 that the Admiral’s men begin to appear at Court. On the
whole, it commends itself to me as the more probable conjecture that
the first Earl of Worcester’s company passed into Howard’s service,
when he became Admiral in 1585, and that the players of the fourth
Earl of Worcester between 1590 and 1596 were distinct from those of
his father. The issue concerns others besides Edward Alleyn himself.
Amongst the members of Worcester’s company in 1583 were Robert Browne,
James Tunstall, and Richard Jones; and all three of these are found
concerned with Alleyn in matters of theatrical business during 1589–91.
The most important document is a deed of sale by ‘Richarde Jones of
London yoman’ to ‘Edwarde Allen of London gent’ for £37 10s. of ‘all
and singuler suche share parte and porcion of playinge apparrelles,
playe bookes, instrumentes, and other comodities whatsoeuer belonginge
to the same, as I the said Richarde Jones nowe haue or of right ought
to haue joyntlye with the same Edwarde Allen, John Allen citizen and
inholder of London and Roberte Browne yoman’.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> This is dated 3
January 1589. There are also three deeds of sale to Edward and John
Alleyn of theatrical apparel between 1589 and 1591, and to two of these
James Tunstall was a witness.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> On Dr. Greg’s theory as to the date
at which Alleyn took service with the Lord Admiral, the organization
in whose properties Richard Jones had an interest would naturally be
Worcester’s men; on mine it would be the Admiral’s, and it would follow
that Jones and Browne, as well as Alleyn, had joined that company.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
We have seen that James Tunstall had done so by 1590–1. John Alleyn
was an elder brother of Edward. There is nothing to connect him with
Worcester’s men. He was a servant of Lord Sheffield in November 1580
and of the Lord Admiral in 1589.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> A letter of one Elizabeth Socklen
to Edward Alleyn refers to a time ‘when your brother, my lovinge cozen
John Allen, dwelt with my very good lord, Charles Heawarde’, and this
rather suggests that his service was in some household capacity, and
not merely as player.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> If so, it may have been through him that
Edward Alleyn and his fellows became Admiral’s men. The first period of
their activity seems to have lasted from 1585 to 1589, and it was no
doubt Edward Alleyn’s genius, and perhaps also his business capacity,
which enabled them to offer a serious rivalry to the Queen’s company.
I suspect that in 1589 or 1590 they were practically dissolved, and
this view is confirmed by the fact that their most important play was
allowed to get to the hands of the printers. Alleyn, with the help
of his brother, bought up the properties, and allied himself with
Lord Strange’s men, and so far as the Admiral’s continued to exist
at all for the next few years, it was almost entirely in and through
him that it did so. After a financial quarrel with James Burbadge in
May 1591, the combined companies moved to the Rose. There is nothing
to show whether the Alleyns bought up Robert Browne’s interest as
well as that of Richard Jones. At any rate Browne began in 1590 that
series of continental tours which occupied most of the rest of his
career (cf. ch. xiv). Jones joined him in one of these adventures in
1592, and it is possible that John Bradstreet and Thomas Sackville,
who went with them, were also old Admiral’s men. But I do not think
that it is accurate to regard this company, as Dr. Greg seems to be
inclined to do, as being itself under the Admiral’s patronage. It is
true that they obtained a passport from him, but this was probably
given rather in his capacity as warden of the seas than in that of
their lord. His name is not mentioned in any of the foreign records
of their peregrinations. It is not possible to say which, other than
Alleyn, of the members of the 1592–3 Strange’s and Admiral’s company,
whose names have been preserved, came from each of the two contributing
sources. They do not include either John Alleyn or James Tunstall, or
Edward Browne, a Worcester’s man of 1583, who reappears with Tunstall
among the Admiral’s after 1594. Nor is it possible to say how far the
repertory of Strange’s men, as disclosed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> 1592–3 entries in
Henslowe’s diary, included plays drawn from the Admiral’s stock. This
may have been the case with <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, which was
printed as an Admiral’s play in 1594, and with <i>Orlando Furioso</i>,
which contemporary gossip represents Greene as selling first to the
Queen’s and then to the Admiral’s. And it may have been the case with
<i>1 Tamar Cham</i>, which passed to the later Admiral’s. Neither
<i>Tamburlaine</i> nor <i>The Wounds of Civil War</i>, printed like
<i>The Battle of Alcazar</i> as an Admiral’s play in 1594, is recorded
to have been played by Strange’s.</p>

<p>When the companies settled down again to a London life after the
conclusion of the long plague in 1594, the Admiral’s men reconstituted
themselves as an independent company with Alleyn at its head, leaving
the greater number of their recent comrades of the road to pass, as
the Lord Chamberlain’s men, under the patronage of Lord Hunsdon. The
personal alliance between Alleyn and Henslowe, whose step-daughter,
Joan Woodward, he had married on 22 October 1592, led to the
institution of close business relations between the company and the
pawnbroker, and the record of these in the famous diary enables us to
follow with a singular minuteness the almost daily fortunes of the
Admiral’s men during the course of some nine or ten years, broken into
two periods by a reconstruction of the company in 1597 and finally
closing about the time of their conversion into Prince Henry’s men in
1604. The precise nature of the position occupied by Henslowe has been
carefully investigated by Dr. Greg,<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and has already been briefly
considered in these pages (ch. xi). He was not a member of the company,
but its landlord, and, probably to an increasing extent, its financier.
In the former capacity he received, after every day’s performance,
a fluctuating sum, which seems to have represented half the amount
received for admission to the galleries of the house; the other half,
with the payments for entrance to the standing room in the yard, being
divided amongst such of the players as had a share in the profits.
Out of this, of course, they had to meet all expenditure other than
by way of rent, such as the wages of hired men, payments for apparel
and play-books, fees to the Master of the Revels for the licensing of
plays, and the like. In practice it became convenient for Henslowe, who
was a capitalist, while many of the players lived from hand to mouth,
to advance sums to meet such expenditure as it fell due, and to recoup
himself from time to time out of the company’s profits. It seems likely
that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> when the system was in full working, the moiety of the gallery
money, which remained after the deduction of the rent, was assigned for
the purpose of these repayments. During the period 1597–1604 Henslowe’s
entries in his diary are mainly in the nature of a running account of
these advances and of the receipts set off against them; for 1594–7
similar entries occur irregularly, but the principal record is a daily
list, such as Henslowe had already kept during his shorter associations
with Strange’s, the Queen’s, and Sussex’s companies in the course of
1592–4, of each performance given, with the name of the play and of
the amount accruing to Henslowe himself in the form of rent. This list
renders possible a very interesting analysis, both of the repertory of
the company and of some at least of the financial conditions of their
enterprise.</p>

<p>The entries start with the heading, ‘In the name of God Amen begininge
the 14 of Maye 1594 by my lord Admeralls men’. After three days, during
which <i>The Jew of Malta</i>, <i>Cutlack</i>, and <i>The Ranger’s
Comedy</i>, all of which are found in the later repertory of the
company, were given, they stop abruptly.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> To about the same date
may be assigned a fragmentary account, headed ‘Layd owt for my Lorde
Admeralle seruantes as ffoloweth 1594’, and recording expenditure for
coming and going to Court and to Somerset House, the residence of
the Lord Chamberlain, ‘for mackinge of our leater twise’, and ‘for
drinckinge with the jentellmen’, all evidently concerned with the
initial business of forming and licensing the company.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> On 5 June
the account of performances is resumed with a fresh heading, ‘In the
name of God Amen begininge at Newington my Lord Admeralle men and my
Lorde Chamberlen men as ffolowethe 1594’.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Henslowe’s takings only
averaged 9<i>s.</i> for the first ten days, probably on account of the
distance of Newington Butts from London.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The takings for the three
days in May averaged 41<i>s.</i>, and it may perhaps be inferred that
these May performances were at the Rose, and that some fear of renewed
plague on the part of the authorities led to their being relegated to
a safer quarter. The tentative character of these early performances
is shown by the fact that the Admiral’s were still sharing a theatre
with the Chamberlain’s. To the repertory of the latter it seems safe
to assign three of the seven plays produced, <i>Titus Andronicus</i>,
<i>Hamlet</i>, and <i>The Taming of A Shrew</i>, and probably also
a fourth, <i>Hester and Ahasuerus</i>, as there is no later sign of
this amongst the Admiral’s plays. This leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> three others to be
regarded as the Admiral’s contribution, <i>The Jew of Malta</i> and
<i>Cutlack</i>, which they had played in May and were often to play
again, and <i>Belin Dun</i>, to which are attached the letters ‘ne’,
Henslowe’s normal indication of a new play.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> There is nothing in
the order in which the plays were taken to indicate an alternation
of the two companies, and it is likely enough that neither was yet
fully constituted, and that they actually joined forces in the same
performances.</p>

<p>After the tenth play on 15 June, Henslowe drew a line across the
page, and although the entries continue without any indication of a
change in the conditions under which the performances were given, I
can only concur in the conjecture of Mr. Fleay and Dr. Greg that at
this point the Admiral’s plays were transferred to the Rose, and the
combination with the Chamberlain’s ceased.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> A sudden rise in the
amount of Henslowe’s takings, and the absence from the rest of the
list of the four plays named above and of any other attributable to
the Chamberlain’s repertory, are alike strongly in favour of this
view, which may be treated as a practical certainty. Henceforward the
fortunes of the company seem to have followed a smooth course for the
space of three years. Their proceedings may be briefly summed up as
follows. They played for thirty-nine consecutive weeks from 15 June
1594 to 14 March 1595, appearing at Court during this season on 28
December, 1 January, and 6 January. After a break of thirty-seven days
during Lent, opportunity of which was taken to repair the Rose, they
played again for ten weeks from Easter Monday, 21 April, to 26 June
1595. Then came a vacation of fifty-nine days, with visits to Bath and
Maidstone. They began again in London on 25 August 1595 and played for
twenty-seven weeks to 28 February 1596, giving Court performances on
1 January, 4 January, and 22 and 24 February. This took them to the
end of the first week in Lent. After forty-three days’ interval, they
played for fifteen weeks, from Easter Monday, 12 April, to 23 July
1596. Their summer vacation lasted for ninety-five days, and they are
noted during 1595–6 at Coventry, Bath, Gloucester, and Dunwich. In the
autumn they started playing on 27 October, but the receipts were low,
and if the record is complete, they suspended performances between
15 and 25 November, and then went on to 12 February 1597, making up
a season of about fourteen weeks in all. They do not seem to have
played at Court at all this winter. This year they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> rather disregarded
Lent, stopping for eighteen days only, during a reconstruction of the
company, and then playing three days a week until Easter, and then
regularly until the end of July, in all twenty-one weeks. To certain
irregularities at the close of this season it will be necessary to
refer later. During the three years, then, there were three winter
and three summer seasons of London playing, covering about a hundred
and twenty-six weeks. Except in Lent or at the beginning or end of
a season, or occasionally, probably for climatic reasons, at other
times, especially in December, plays were given upon every week-day.
It emerges from Dr. Greg’s re-ordering of Henslowe’s very inaccurate
dates that there were no plays on Sundays.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> On the other hand, a
summons to play at Court in the evening did not necessarily entail a
blank day in the afternoon. The total number of performances during
the three years was seven hundred and twenty-eight. It is reasonable
to assume that Henslowe’s takings varied roughly with those of the
company, although the reserve must be made that different plays
might prove the most attractive to the galleries and to the yard
respectively. The amounts entered range from a minimum of 3<i>s.</i> to
a maximum of 73<i>s.</i> Dr. Greg calculates the average over ‘certain
typical periods of 1595’ as 30<i>s.</i>;<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> during the first half
of 1597 it was 24<i>s.</i> The fluctuations are determined, partly
by the popularity or novelty of the plays presented, partly by the
season of the year, and doubtless the weather and the competition
of other amusements. There were generally some high receipts during
Christmas, Easter, and Whitsun weeks. Unfortunately there is no means
of estimating the proportion which Henslowe’s share bore to that
which fell for division among the players. Some light is thrown upon
the expenses by the subsidiary accounts of advances, which Henslowe
began to keep from time to time in 1596. In May of that year he lent
Alleyn ‘for the company’ a total amount of £39 in several instalments,
and recovered it by small sums of £1 to £3 at a time during the next
three months.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> A longer account extending from October 1596 to
March 1597 reaches, with the aid of a miscalculation, a total of £52.
Of this £22 was repaid during the same period, chiefly by deductions
from the profits of first nights, and an acknowledgement given for the
balance of £30.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The advances were made through various members of
the company, and the purposes specified include apparel for three new
plays, travelling expenses, and fees to playwrights. A third account,
if I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> right in the interpretation of some very disputable figures,
shows an expenditure at the average rate of 31<i>s.</i> a day during
the six months from 24 January to 28 July 1597, of which, however,
nearly half was in fact incurred during the first twenty-four days of
the period. In this case only the sums and not the purposes for which
they were advanced are entered.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>


<p>During the three years the Admiral’s men produced new plays to the
total number of fifty-five, and at the average rate of one a fortnight.
The productions were not at regular intervals, and often followed each
other in successive weeks. There is, however, no example of two new
productions in the same week.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> These are the names and dates of the

<p>Oblivion has overtaken the great majority of these plays.
<i>Longshanks</i> is possibly Peele’s <i>Edward I</i>, and
<i>Jeronimo</i> certainly Kyd’s <i>Spanish Tragedy</i>. The title of
<i>The Wise Man of West Chester</i> agrees with the subject of Munday’s
<i>John a Kent</i> and <i>John a Cumber</i>, the manuscript of which is
dated December 1595. One would be more willing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> identify <i>Henry
V</i> with <i>The Famous Victories</i>, if the latter had not been
printed in 1598 with the name of the Queen’s men on its title-page.
<i>A Knack to Know an Honest Man</i> was printed, as acted ‘about
the Citie of London’, but without any company name, in 1596 (S. R.
26 November 1595). <i>Stukeley</i> was also printed without a name,
as <i>The Famous History of the Life and Death of Captain Thomas
Stukeley</i>, in 1605 (S. R. 11 August 1600). <i>1 Tamar Cham</i> and
<i>Frederick and Basilea</i> are extant in ‘plots’ alone, and <i>Belin
Dun</i>, or <i>Bellendon</i>, as Henslowe writes it, was entered in
the Stationers’ Register on 24 November 1595 as <i>The true tragicall
historie of Kinge Rufus the first with the life and deathe of Belyn
Dun the first thief that ever was hanged in England</i>, but is not
known to be extant. The list also contains two of the early works of
George Chapman, <i>The Blind Beggar of Alexandria</i> (1598, Admiral’s,
S. R. 15 August 1598), and <i>The Comedy of Humours</i>, which can be
safely identified with <i>A Humorous Day’s Mirth</i> (1599, Admiral’s).
Ingenious attempts have been made to trace in some of the remaining
titles other plays by Chapman, or by Heywood, Dekker, and the like, or
presumed early drafts of these, or the English originals of plays or
titles preserved in German versions; but in most cases the material
available is so scanty as to render the game a hazardous one.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> It
appears, however, from Henslowe’s notes of advances during 1596–7 that
payment was made to Heywood for a book, from which it may be inferred
that his activity as a dramatist for the company had already began.
Payments to ‘marcum’ and ‘Mr. porter’ perhaps indicate the same of
Gervase Markham and Henry Porter.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that some of the plays marked ‘ne’ by Henslowe cannot
have been new in the fullest sense. This applies to <i>Jeronimo</i>,
which had been played by Strange’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> men as an old play during 1592–3,
and to <i>2 Tamar Cham</i>, which had been produced by the same company
on 28 April 1592, and on that occasion also marked ‘ne’ by Henslowe.
It applies also to <i>Longshanks</i> and <i>Henry V</i>, if these are
really the same as <i>Edward I</i> and <i>The Famous Victories</i>.
And it may, of course, apply also in other cases, which cannot now be
distinguished. Two explanations are possible. One is that plays were
treated as new, for the purpose of Henslowe’s entries, which were only
new to the repertory of the particular company concerned, having been
purchased by them or by Henslowe from the stock of some other company.
There is, however, no indication that Henslowe received any special
financial advantage from the production of a new play, such as would
give point to such an arrangement. The other, and perhaps the most
plausible, is that an old play was marked ‘ne’ if it had undergone any
substantial process of revision before revival. But it must be admitted
that the problem set is one that we have hardly the means to solve.</p>

<p>In addition to their new and revised plays, the Admiral’s had a
considerable stock of old ones. Some of these they were playing, when
they began their first season in June 1594. Several others were revived
in the course of that season, and a few at later dates. The only new
play of the repertory which reached the stage of revival during the
three years was <i>Belin Dun</i>, which was originally produced on 10
June 1594, played to the end of the year, then dropped, and afterwards
revived for a single performance on 11 July 1596, and for a series
in the spring of 1597. But it is not likely that many new plays were
written during the plague years, and probably most of the revived plays
of 1594–5 were a good deal more than two or three years old. A list of
the plays not marked ‘ne’ by Henslowe, nineteen in number, follows.
It is, however, possible that some of them are only plays in the list
already given, masquerading under different names.</p>

  <li><i>Cutlack.</i></li>
  <li><i>The Ranger’s Comedy.</i></li>
  <li><i>The Guise</i>, or, <i>The Massacre of Paris.</i></li>

  <li><i>Warlamchester.</i></li>
  <li><i>2 Tamburlaine.</i></li>
  <li><i>The Siege of London.</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></li>

  <li><i>1 Fortunatus.</i></li>
  <li><i>Osric.</i></li>
  <li><i>Time’s Triumph and Fortune’s.</i></li>
  <li><i>The Witch of Islington.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Five plays of Marlowe’s are conspicuous in the list. <i>Mahomet</i>
might be either Greene’s <i>Alphonsus</i>, <i>King of Arragon</i>
or Peele’s lost <i>Turkish Mahomet and Hiren the Fair Greek</i>.
<i>Fortunatus</i>, as revised by Dekker in 1599, is extant, but it
is doubtful whether Dekker was writing early enough to have been the
author of the original play. Conjectural identifications of some
of the other titles have been attempted.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> There is, perhaps, a
natural inclination to eke out our meagre knowledge of the repertory
of the earlier Admiral’s men, as it was constituted before 1590, by
the assumption that the old and the revised new plays of 1594–7 belong
to that stock. But this can only be proved to be so in the case of
<i>1 and 2 Tamburlaine</i>, where the title-page of the 1590 edition
comes to our assistance. There is no trace between 1594 and 1597 of
any of the other three plays, <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, <i>The
Wounds of Civil War</i>, and <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, which there is
independent evidence for connecting with the Admiral’s. And it must
be borne in mind that there were several other sources from which
a supply of old plays might be drawn. Alleyn seems to have bought
up the books and properties of the pre-1590 men, and we do not know
how far he also retained rights in some or all of the plays produced
during his alliance with Strange’s. Moreover, there were plenty of
opportunities for either Alleyn, Henslowe, or the Admiral’s men as a
whole, to acquire copies from one or more of the companies, Pembroke’s,
the Queen’s, Sussex’s, which went under in the plague years. <i>Henry
V</i>, if identical with <i>The Famous Victories</i>, had certainly
been a Queen’s play; <i>The Ranger’s Comedy</i> had been played for
Henslowe by the Queen’s and Sussex’s in April 1594; <i>Jeronimo</i> and
<i>The Guise</i> had been similarly played by Strange’s in 1592–3; and
the fact that Strange’s, the Queen’s, Sussex’s, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> Admiral’s, all
in turn played <i>The Jew of Malta</i> leads to a strong suspicion that
it was Henslowe’s property and placed by him at the disposal of any
company that might from time to time be occupying his theatre.</p>

<p>The Rose was what is now known as a ‘repertory’ house. A very
successful play might be repeated on the night after its first
production or revival, or in the course of the same week. But as a
rule one performance a week was the limit, and after a play had been
on the boards a few weeks, the intervals between its appearances
rapidly became greater. <i>The Wise Man of West Chester</i>, which
was presented thirty-two times between December 1594 and July 1597,
had a longer life than any other new play during the three years.
Next came <i>A Knack to Know an Honest Man</i>, with twenty-one
performances in two years, <i>1 Seven Days of the Week</i>, with
twenty-one performances in fifteen months, and <i>The Blind Beggar
of Alexandria</i>, with twenty-two performances in fourteen months.
<i>Belin Dun</i>, although not continuously upon the stage for long
together, achieved with the aid of its revival a total of twenty-four
performances. The only other new plays, that outlived a year, were <i>2
Godfrey of Bulloigne</i> and <i>A Toy to Please Chaste Ladies</i>.
Even such highly successful plays as <i>1 and 2 Hercules</i> ceased
to be heard of after six months. The usual run of a play was anything
from six to seventeen nights, but sixteen plays failed to obtain even
such a run, and several plays, which apparently did well enough on the
first night, were not repeated at all. As a rule the first night of a
play brought Henslowe the highest returns; but this was by no means
invariably the case, and the success of any play, which held the boards
for as many as six nights, can perhaps best be measured by its average
returns. By far the most fortunate was <i>The Comedy of Humours</i>
which averaged 53<i>s.</i> for the eleven nights available before
the summer season of 1597 closed. Next came <i>1 and 2 Hercules</i>
with 42<i>s.</i> and 43<i>s.</i> respectively, <i>1 Seven Days of the
Week</i> with 35<i>s.</i>, and <i>The Wise Man of West Chester</i> with
34<i>s.</i> On the other hand the average of <i>Henry I</i> was no more
than 19<i>s.</i> and that of the second <i>French Comedy</i> no more
than 16<i>s.</i> The highest individual returns were those from the
first nights of <i>1 and 2 Hercules</i>, <i>2 Godfrey of Bulloigne</i>,
and <i>1 Seven Days of the Week</i>, which yielded 73<i>s.</i>,
70<i>s.</i>, 71<i>s.</i>, and 70<i>s.</i> respectively, and that
from the sixth night of the <i>Comedy of Humours</i>, which was also
70<i>s.</i> The booking for this play shows a curious progress, being
43<i>s.</i>, 55<i>s.</i>, 58<i>s.</i>, 64<i>s.</i>, 66<i>s.</i>,
70<i>s.</i>, for the first six nights. Similarly <i>The Wise Man of
West Chester</i>, which began with a bad first night of 33<i>s.</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
rose to a good average, while <i>2 Godfrey of Bulloigne</i>, for all
its start of 70<i>s.</i>, ended with an average of only 28<i>s.</i> The
worst first night taking was the 22<i>s.</i> of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>,
and this affords another curious example of box-office fluctuations,
for, though it achieved no higher average than 22<i>s.</i>, it rose on
its third night to 68<i>s.</i> The worst takings, on other than first
nights, were 3<i>s.</i> for <i>Chinon of England</i>,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> 4<i>s.</i>
for <i>Vortigern</i>, and for <i>Olympo</i>, and 5<i>s.</i> twice
over for <i>A Woman Hard to Please</i>. Probably these were due to
weather or other accidents, as each play averaged enough to justify a
reasonable run. The success of the old plays followed much the same
lines as that of the new ones. They ran for anything from one night to
twenty-four, this total being reached by <i>Dr. Faustus</i>. The best
average returns were the 32<i>s.</i> and 38<i>s.</i> of <i>1 and 2
Tamburlaine</i>, the 30<i>s.</i> of <i>Mahomet</i>, the 29<i>s.</i> of
<i>1 Long Meg of Westminster</i>, the 27<i>s.</i> of <i>The Guise</i>,
and the 26<i>s.</i> of <i>The Jew of Malta</i>; the best individual
returns the 72<i>s.</i> and 71<i>s.</i> yielded by the respective
first nights of <i>Dr. Faustus</i> and <i>1 Tamburlaine</i>. The
persistent popularity of Marlowe’s work comes out quite clearly from
the statistics; and the success of Chapman’s first attempts is also not
to be overlooked.</p>

<p>The <i>personnel</i> of the Admiral’s men during 1594–7 can be
determined with some approach to certainty. They were Edward Alleyn,
John Singer, Richard Jones, Thomas Towne, Martin Slater, Edward Juby,
Thomas Downton, and James Donstone. Their names are found in a list
written in the diary, without any explanation of its object, amongst
memoranda of 1594–6.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> There can be little doubt that it represents
the principal members of the company, and in most cases corroborative
evidence is available. The books of the Treasurer of the Chamber
indicate Alleyn, Jones, and Singer as payees for the Court money of
1594–5, and Alleyn and Slater for that of 1595–6. Alleyn, Slater,
Donstone, and Juby are noted in Henslowe’s subsidiary accounts for 1596
as responsible for advances made by him on behalf of the company.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
Another advance was made to Stephen the tireman, and he is doubtless
the Stephen Magett who also appears in personal financial relations
with Henslowe during 1596.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Transactions by way of loan, sale,
or pawn are also noted by Henslowe during 1594–7 with Slater, Jones,
Donstone, Singer, and Towne, and also with Edward Dutton and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> Richard
Alleyn.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> These latter were probably not sharers in the company,
but can be traced with others amongst its subordinate members by means
of the ‘plot’ of <i>Frederick and Basilea</i>, which it is reasonable
to connect with the performances of the play in June and July 1597,
since it was a new play on 3 June, and it is recorded in the diary
that Martin Slater, who figures in the ‘plot’, left the company on
18 July. It is to be inferred from the plot that the principal parts
in <i>Frederick and Basilea</i> were taken by Mr. Alleyn, Mr. Thomas
Towne, Mr. Martin [Slater], Mr. Juby, Mr. Donstone, and R. Alleyn;
that minor male parts were taken by Edward Dutton, Thomas Hunt, Robert
Ledbetter, Black Dick, Pigge, Sam, Charles, and the ‘gatherers’ or
money-takers and other ‘attendants’; and that female parts were taken
by Edward Dutton’s boy Dick and two other boys known as Will and
Griffen. Apparently the play, although not employing all the principal
actors, made considerable demands on the minor staff. Dr. Greg may
be right in identifying Sam and Charles with the Samuel Rowley and
Charles Massey who became members of the company at a later date.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
It will be seen that the only name in Henslowe’s undated list which
cannot be verified as that of a member of the company during 1594–7
is that of Thomas Downton; but it may safely be accepted. Downton had
accompanied Alleyn on the provincial tour with Strange’s men in 1593.
So had Pigge or Pyk. Jones and Donstone, who is the same as Tunstall,
had belonged to Worcester’s men in 1583, and probably to the Admiral’s
men before 1590; Jones had been abroad, as we have seen, during the
plague years. John Singer had been a member of the Queen’s men in 1588.
The other names now come into the story for the first time. Henslowe’s
advances for 1596 included sums ‘to feache Fletcher’ and ‘to feache
Browne’.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> It can only be matter of conjecture whether there is
evidence here of negotiations for the incorporation in the company of
Robert Browne and of Laurence Fletcher, at a later date a colleague of
Slater’s, and if so, whether they led to any fruitful result.</p>

<p>The departure of Martin Slater on 18 July 1597 was only one of several
changes which profoundly modified the composition of the company in
the course of that year.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> In February<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> Richard Jones and Thomas
Downton went to the Swan as Pembroke’s men, and the disturbance thereby
caused probably accounts for the three weeks’ cessation of playing
during Lent. The Swan enterprise was brought to a disastrous conclusion
after five months by the production of <i>The Isle of Dogs</i>, which
not only brought personal trouble on the chief offenders, but also led
to a restraint of plays at all the theatres. This event synchronizes
with the first appearance in the diary of Nashe’s collaborator in
<i>The Isle of Dogs</i>, Ben Jonson. On 28 July Henslowe lent him no
less a sum than £4, and took Alleyn and Singer as witnesses. On the
same day he opened an account headed ‘℞ of Bengemenes Johnsones share
as ffoloweth’ with a first instalment of 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i><a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
On this very day of 28 July the Privy Council’s inhibition fell, and
Jonson went to prison and paid no more instalments. It is impossible to
say whether his ‘share’ was in the Admiral’s company or in Pembroke’s.
In any event, although he continued to write for the Admiral’s men
after 1597, there is no further sign that he was either a ‘sharer’, or
indeed an actor in any capacity.</p>

<p>One result of the restraint was that Jones and Downton not merely
returned to the Rose, but brought at least three other of Pembroke’s
men, Robert Shaw, Gabriel Spencer, and William Bird, known also by the
<i>alias</i> of Borne, with them. Henslowe was thus enabled, almost
immediately after playing stopped, to set about the reconstitution of
his company, and the memoranda of agreement which he noted in his diary
during the next fourteen months are so interesting for the light which
they throw upon his relations with the actors, that I think it well,
before discussing them, to transcribe them in full. There are in all
eleven of them, as follows:<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>Evidently the position of James Bristow is distinct from that of the
other players. He was a ‘boy’ or apprentice, whose indentures had been
transferred to Henslowe for a consideration by his former master. In
the rest of the cases, the essence of the agreement appears to be the
undertaking by the player under bond to play only with the Admiral’s
men at Henslowe’s house. It is interesting to notice that in the
agreement with Hearne Henslowe calls the company ‘my company’; and the
fact that its members were constituted Henslowe’s covenant servants
seems to argue a closer personal relation between the organization
and its financier, than might on other grounds have been inferred.
Dr. Greg, indeed, draws a distinction between the agreements with
Jones, Shaw, Borne, and Downton, whom he regards as merely ‘binding
themselves to play at Henslowe’s house like other sharers’, and those
with the rest, whom he regards as ‘placing themselves in the position
of covenant servants to him, which would seem to imply that they
were merely hired men’.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> But I do not think that there is any
justification for this theory in the terms of the documents, and it
immediately gets Dr. Greg into difficulties about Massey and Rowley,
who, as we shall see, were in fact on the footing of full members of
the company even before the date of their agreement. I do not mean
that I deny the distinction between sharers and hired men, which is of
course important, but that I do not think that it is relevant to the
contractual relations set up by the agreements. I am not quite clear
whether Henslowe’s memoranda, which are written throughout, including
the names of the witnesses, in his own hand or Alleyn’s, constitute
the formal instruments under which the agreements were effected, or
are merely notes for his own information. But in either event their
terminology is loose. They are not always expressed as being agreements
of hiring, or for service, even in the cases of those men whom Dr.
Greg does not suppose to have been sharers, and they are not careful
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span> specify the considerations, other than the formal 2<i>d.</i> or
3<i>d.</i>, which the actors were to receive. Wages are, in fact,
provided for only in the agreements with Hearne and Kendall, and it
is quite possible that, if we had the full terms before us, we should
find that, while some of the others were also to receive wages, some
were to find their recompense in a share of such profits as the company
might make. It is probable that, even where Henslowe undertook to pay
wages, the general agreement between him and the company provided for
the shifting of that liability to them. They certainly had to pay
him, at the rate of 3<i>s.</i> a week, for the services of his boy
Bristow.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> To a slightly later date belongs an agreement with an
unnamed actor, in which the hirer is not Henslowe but Thomas Downton,
and this I add in order to complete the series.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>The appearance of Jones as guarantee for Shaw is due to the fact that,
as a result of <i>The Isle of Dogs</i>, the latter was languishing
with Gabriel Spencer and Ben Jonson in the Marshalsea. Meanwhile some
at least of the company travelled. Henslowe lent Alleyn 40<i>s.</i>
for John Singer and Thomas Towne ‘when they went into the contrey’ and
noted that this was ‘at ther last cominge’. There is another entry
of a small loan to Singer on 9 August, so they cannot have started
before that; and they must have been back by 6 October, when Singer
witnessed the agreement with Thomas Downton. Possibly Edward Dutton
and Richard Alleyn, who also borrowed money from Henslowe, went with
them.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The Privy Council warrants for the release of the prisoners
in the Marshalsea were signed on 3 October,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> and a few days later
Henslowe, more successful than Langley of the Swan in getting the
licence for his house renewed, even before the formal expiration of the
restraint on 1 November, was in a position to resume his play list with
the heading, ‘The xj of Octobe begane my lord Admerals &amp; my lorde of
Penbrockes men to play at my howsse 1597’.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> The entries of plays
are few and irregular up to 5 November, and then stop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> A note is
appended that on 26 November the Master of the Revels was paid for four
weeks. The performances included one new play, <i>Friar Spendleton</i>,
and five old ones, <i>Jeronimo</i>, <i>The Comedy of Humours</i>,
<i>Dr. Faustus</i>, <i>Hardicanute</i>, and <i>Bourbon</i>, of which
the last two do not belong to the 1594–7 repertory, and may have been
contributed by Pembroke’s men. The diary also contains an account of
weekly receipts running from 21 October 1597 to 4 March 1598, under
the heading, ‘A juste a cownte of all suche monye as I haue receyed of
my lord Admeralles &amp; my lord of Penbrocke men as foloweth be gynynge
the 21 of October 1597’, and some notes of individual advances and
repayments, mainly through Robert Shaw and Thomas Downton, on behalf
of the company, from 23 October to 12 December.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> In the course of
these the company is again described on 23 October and 5 November as
‘the company of my lord Admeralles men &amp; my lord Penbrockes’, but on 1
December as ‘the companey of my lord Admeralles men’; and the substance
of the whole of these advances is set out again, without any reference
to Pembroke’s men, at the beginning of a continuous account from 21
October onwards, which is headed, ‘A juste a cownt of all suche money
as I haue layd owt for my lord Admeralles players begynyng the xj of
October whose names ar as foloweth Borne Gabrell Shaw Jonnes Dowten
Jube Towne Synger &amp; the ij Geffes’.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Nothing very certain is known
of the previous career of Humphrey and Anthony Jeffes, but if the
former is the ‘Humfrey’ who appears with ‘Gabriel’ [Spencer] in the
stage-directions to <i>3 Henry VI</i> it is most likely that these men
also came from Pembroke’s.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>The responsible members of the Admiral’s company at the beginning
of the third period of their existence were, then, so far as their
relations to Henslowe were concerned, Thomas Downton, Richard Jones,
Edward Juby, Thomas Towne, John Singer, Robert Shaw, William Borne, who
seems to have had the regular <i>alias</i> of William Bird, Gabriel
Spencer, Humphrey Jeffes, and Anthony Jeffes. To these must probably
be added a number of hired men, including Thomas Hearne, John Helle,
William Kendall, Richard Alleyn, Thomas Heywood, and probably Charles
Massey, Samuel Rowley, Thomas Hunt, and Stephen Maget the tireman,
and of apprentices, including James Bristow and Pigge. Of the sharers
Downton, Jones, Juby, Towne, and Singer had alone belonged to the
earlier Admiral’s men. Slater’s departure involved the company in a
lawsuit, the nature of which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> not stated in the diary. Professor
Wallace, however, has found an independent record of a Queen’s Bench
action by Thomas Downton to recover £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, the
value of a playbook which Downton had lost in the parish of St. Mary le
Bow on 1 December 1597, and Slater had ‘found’, refused to surrender,
and was alleged to have disposed of for his own profit. Damages of
£10 10<i>s.</i> were awarded on 3 November 1598.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Donstone also
seems to have dropped out or may have been dead; he witnessed Helle’s
agreement on 3 August 1597, and thereafter no more is heard of him.
But incomparably the greatest loss was that of Edward Alleyn, who
now retired from the stage and did not return to it for a period of
three years.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> From 29 December 1597 to 8 November 1598 Henslowe
made notes of playing goods bought ‘sence my sonne Edward Allen
leafte [p]laynge’, and it would appear that the company acknowledged
a debt of £50 in respect of his interest on retirement.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> In place
of Alleyn, it would seem that the lead was taken by Robert Shaw and
Thomas Downton, perhaps as representing the two elements of which the
company was made up. These two were joint payees for the Court money
of both 1597–8 and 1598–9. For 1599–1600 Shaw was sole payee. It was,
moreover, most often, although by no means always, to one or other
of these men that Henslowe’s advances on behalf of the company were
made. It must be added that some of the new-comers appear to have
sought private assistance from Henslowe in order to enable them to
take up their shares. On 14 January 1598, he opened an account of sums
received ‘of Humfreye Jeaffes hallfe share’, entered seven instalments
up to 4 March, amounting to a total of 60<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and
then noted, ‘This some was payd backe agayne vnto the companey of my
lord Admeralles players the 8 of Marche 1598, &amp; they shared yt amonste
them’. There is a later account, running from 29 April to 21 July
1598, and amounting by small instalments to 35<i>s.</i>, of ‘all such
money as I dooe receue for Umfrey Jeaffes and Antoney Jeaffes ... of
the companey’.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Possibly the brothers only held a single share
between them. A similar transaction took place with Gabriel Spencer. On
20 April 1598 this actor gave an acknowledgement for £4 and between 6
April and 24 June Henslowe carried to an account headed ‘℞ of Gabrell
Spencer at severall tymes of his share in the gallereyes’ a total of
25<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, of which 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was paid over to
Downton.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> In addition, personal loans were negotiated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> from time
to time by various members of the company, and the reasons given for
these indicate that in the course of 1598, besides the dispute of the
ex-Pembroke’s men with Langley, Bird and perhaps the company as a whole
were engaged in litigation with Thomas Pope, presumably the actor in
the Chamberlain’s company.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>There does not seem to have been much further change in the composition
of the Admiral’s men during 1597–1600. An acknowledgement of the state
of their account with Henslowe between 8 and 13 March 1598 bears the
signatures of ‘J. Singer, Thomas Downton, William Birde, Robt Shaa,
Richard Jones, Gabriell Spenser, Thomas Towne, Humfry Jeffes, Charles
Massye, and Samuell Rowlye’.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> The last two had evidently become
sharers in the course of the year. Juby and Anthony Jeffes do not sign,
but this is probably due to an accident, as they were certainly sharers
both in 1597 and in 1600.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Gabriel Spencer was killed by Ben Jonson
(cf. ch. xxiii) on 22 September 1598. On 26 September Henslowe wrote to
Alleyn at the Brill in Sussex, ‘Now to leat you vnderstand newes I will
teall you some but yt is for me harde &amp; heavey. Sence you weare with
me I haue loste one of my company which hurteth me greatley; that is
Gabrell, for he is slayen in Hogesden fylldes by the handes of Bengemen
Jonson bricklayer’.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> No doubt Henslowe wrote from the heart.
Probably Spencer’s share was not yet paid for, and in addition small
personal loans to the amount of 66<i>s.</i> stand undischarged against
him in the diary, of which the last was on 19 May ‘to bye a plume of
feathers which his mane Bradshawe feched of me’. Richard Bradshaw
was an actor and may have played as a hired man with the company. A
fragmentary ‘plot’ of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, probably to be dated
in April 1599, yields the names of ‘Mr. Jones’ and his ‘boy’, Thomas
Hunt, Stephen, Proctor, and Pigge. Mr. Jones’s boy is shown by a note
of 17 November 1599 in the diary to have been called James.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Of
Proctor no more is known. Stephen is probably Stephen Magett, the
tireman, and Pigge was with Alleyn on the tour of Strange’s men in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
1593. He is also mentioned, with Dobe, Whittcombe, and Anderson, who
may have been actors, in some inventories of properties belonging to
Alleyn or to the company in March 1598.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Thomas Downton also had in
June 1600 a ‘boye’ who played in <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Another
acknowledgement of account, dated on 10 July 1600, only differs from
the former one by the omission of Spencer’s name and the inclusion of
those of Juby and Anthony Jeffes.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The alleged manuscript notes
to a copy of Dekker’s <i>Shoemaker’s Holiday</i> (q.v.), produced in
January 1600, which are discredited by Dr. Greg, give the cast as
composed of ‘Jones, H. Jeffes, Rowley, Shawe, Massy, Dowton, Singer,
Jewby, Towne, A. Jeffes, Birde, Wilson, Flower, Price, Day, Dowton’s
boy Ned and Alleine’; the last for a female part. Certainly nothing is
known of Day or Wilson as actors for the Admiral’s, or of Price at any
such early date, or of Flower at all. But if the document is a forgery,
it is a very pointless, and at the same time a very cautious one. And
how did the forger, unless he were Collier or Cunningham, know that Day
was an actor at all?</p>

<p>The records kept by Henslowe for the period 1597–1600 differ
considerably in character from those for 1594–7. The diurnal list of
plays performed and of rent-takings disappears altogether. On the
other hand, the records of advances made, for the books and licensing
of plays, for costumes and properties, and for certain miscellaneous
items of expenditure, become full and systematic. A <i>per contra</i>
account is also kept of weekly sums received by Henslowe in repayment
of such advances, and from time to time a balance is struck, and the
hands of the company taken to a settlement or acknowledgement of debt.
Henslowe’s book-keeping, however, if not exactly faulty, is not always
sufficiently lucid to make the whole of the financial transactions
perfectly clear. In the absence of the daily entries of performances,
the weekly records of repayments make it possible to determine roughly
the periods covered by the theatrical seasons.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> The company played
for twenty continuous weeks from 11 October 1597 to about 4 March 1598,
apparently with some irregularity at the beginning and again about
Christmas time. Their Court plays were on 27 December and 28 February.
In Lent they had a three weeks’ interval, during the course of which
they met to read a book in New Fish Street, and ‘played in Fleatstreet
pryuat’.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Playing was resumed about 25 March and lasted for some
fifteen weeks, until about 8 July, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> thirty-five weeks in all
for the year 1597–8. The company only took two weeks’ vacation in the
summer and are not likely to have travelled, although on 27 September,
after the new season had begun, Borne is found riding to the Lord
Admiral at Croydon at the time of the Queen’s visit there.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> They
played for thirty-one weeks from about 22 July to 24 February 1599,
with performances at Court on 27 December, 6 January and 18 February,
and stopped for three weeks in Lent. The summer season lasted for
eleven weeks from about 19 March to 3 June, making forty-four weeks
playing for 1598–9. On Easter Eve Towne and Richard Alleyn went to
Court for some unspecified purpose. About the same time Anthony Jeffes
was making purchases against St. George’s Day.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The interval
of this summer was seventeen weeks, but I have no evidence of any
travelling. The next season was one of nineteen weeks from about 29
September 1599 to 10 February 1600, with Court performances on 27
December and 1 January, and was followed by a Lenten interval of
about four weeks. At the beginning of February they bought a drum and
trumpets ‘when to go into the contry’.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Whether these were for
use during the short break in Lent or not until the following summer
must remain uncertain; at any rate the purchase confirms the view that
there had been no provincial tour since 1596.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Finally they played
for nineteen weeks from about 2 March to 13 July, thus completing
thirty-six weeks for 1599–1600. Apparently the summer season was
diversified by a visit to Windsor for the Garter installation of Henri
IV of France on 27 April.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> In all they seem to have played for
about 115 weeks or something under 690 days in 1597–1600, as compared
with 728 days in 1594–7.</p>

<p>The entries of sums paid for plays usually give the names of the
authors as well as those of the plays, and therefore furnish a good
deal of material for reconstituting the literary side of the company’s
activity. Henslowe’s terminology is neither precise nor uniform, but
it is clear that, while the payments were always entered as loans to
the company, they were often made direct by him to the playwrights,
on the ‘appointment’ of one or more of its members. Sometimes they
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> expressed as being ‘to bye a boocke of’ a play; that is to say,
for the purchase outright of an old or even a new manuscript. But a
new play was generally commissioned, upon the strength of a sample
or of an outline of the plot, and in such cases payment was made by
instalments, of which the earlier ones were ‘lent upon’ or ‘in earneste
of’ or ‘in parte paymente of’, and the last ‘in full paymente of’ the
book. Portions of the manuscript were handed over as security for the
earlier payments. Production was very rapid, and a play put together
in two or three weeks often represented the collaboration of as many
as four or even five or six authors. The procedure, which prevailed
during the whole of the period covered by the diary, is illustrated by
a small group of letters preserved amongst the miscellaneous papers
found at Dulwich. Thus on 8 November 1599 Shaw writes with regard to
<i>2 Henry Richmond</i>, ‘Mr. Henshlowe, we haue heard their booke and
lyke yt. Their pryce is eight poundes, which I pray pay now to Mr.
Wilson, according to our promysse’; and accordingly Henslowe includes
in his account, by an entry written and signed by Wilson, a sum of £8
‘by a note vnder the hand of Mr. Rob: Shaw’.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> On 14 June 1600 Shaw
writes again, ‘I pray you, Mr. Henshlowe, deliuer vnto the bringer
hereof the some of fyue &amp; fifty shillinges to make the 3<sup>ll</sup> fyue
shillinges which they receaued before full six poundes in full payment
of their booke called the fayre Constance of Roome, whereof I pray
you reserue for me Mr. Willsons whole share which is xj<sup>s</sup>. which I to
supply his neede deliuered him yesternight.’ The diary duly records the
payment to Drayton, Hathway, Munday, and Dekker ‘at the a poyntment of
Roberte Shawe’ of 44<i>s.</i><a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Similarly Samuel Rowley writes on 4
April 1601, ‘Mr. Hinchloe, I haue harde fyue shetes of a playe of the
Conqueste of the Indes &amp; I dow not doute but it wyll be a verye good
playe; tharefore I praye ye delyuer them fortye shyllynges in earneste
of it &amp; take the papers into your one hands &amp; on Easter eue thaye
promyse to make an ende of all the reste’. The earnest and several
supplementary earnests were paid to Day, Haughton, and Smith, but the
completion of the play lagged until the following September.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> An
undated letter of Rowley’s relates to the withdrawal of a play, ‘Mr.
Hynchlo, I praye ye let Mr. Hathwaye haue his papars agayne of the
playe of John a Gante &amp; for the repayement of the monye back agayne
he is contente to gyue ye a byll of his hande to be payde at some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
cartayne tyme as in your dyscressyon yow shall thinke good; which done
ye may crose it oute of your boouke &amp; keepe the byll; or else wele
stande so much indetted to you &amp; kepe the byll our selues’. Henslowe
appears to have thought it safer to adopt the second alternative,
as incomplete payments to the amount of £1 19<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>
for <i>The Conquest of Spain by John of Gaunt</i> still stand in his
‘boouke’.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Other letters of the same kind concern <i>Six Yeomen of
the West</i>, and <i>Too Good to be True</i>.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The normal price for
a new play during 1597–1601 seems to have been £6, but sometimes it
fell to £5 or possibly even £4, and sometimes the playwrights succeeded
in squeezing out a few shillings more. One or two of them, notably
Chapman, were able to secure a higher rate from the beginning; and
about 1599 a general tendency towards a higher scale of prices becomes
discernible. The ‘book’ of an old play could generally be purchased for
about £2.</p>

<p>In attempting to estimate the actual ‘output’ of the company, one
is faced by the difficulty that some of the plays commissioned are
not shown by the diary to have reached the stage of payment in full,
and that it must, therefore, remain doubtful whether they were ever
completed. It is possible that, as Dr. Greg thinks,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> some of the
payments were made direct by the company, instead of through Henslowe.
But the correspondence just quoted rather suggests that any such
arrangement would be exceptional; and it would not be inconsistent
with human nature, if the extremely out-at-elbows men of letters
who hung about the Rose occasionally found it profitable to take
their ‘earnest’ for a play, and then to find plausible reasons for
indefinitely delaying its completion. Probably in the long run they
had to account for the advance, but the example of <i>The Conquest of
Spain</i> shows that such a repayment would not necessarily find its
way into Henslowe’s account. This view is borne out by an examination
of the affairs of one of the most impecunious of them all, Henry
Chettle, during 1598–9. During the first six months of the year, he
had a hand in half a dozen plays, all of which were completed and paid
for in full. But on one of these, <i>1 Black Bateman of the North</i>,
Henslowe appears, perhaps by an oversight, to have paid him £1 too
much. At the beginning of May £1 was lent to Chettle upon this play,
and the loan does not appear to have been considered when, on 22 May,
a further sum of £6 was laid out upon ‘a boocke called Blacke Battmane
of the North ... which coste sixe powndes’. On 24 June Chettle borrowed
10<i>s.</i>, not apparently on any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> particular play, and Henslowe seems
then to have recalled the overpayment, and noted against Chettle’s
name in the diary, ‘All his parte of boockes to this place are payde
which weare dew unto hime &amp; he reastes be syddes in my deatte the
some of xxx<sup>s</sup>.’ Chettle collaborated in several other plays, which
got completed during the year, but no deduction seems to have been
made from his share of the fees in respect of this debt. In addition
he had £5 upon <i>A Woman’s Tragedy</i>, upon condition ‘eather to
deliver the playe or els to paye the mony with in one forthnyght’; he
had 5<i>s.</i> in earnest upon <i>Catiline’s Conspiracy</i>; and he
had £1 14<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> in earnest upon <i>Brute</i>, probably a
continuation of an older <i>1 Brute</i> bought by the company. When the
last payment on <i>Brute</i> was made on 16 September Henslowe noted,
‘Hary Cheattell vntell this place owes vs viij<sup>li</sup> ix<sup>s</sup> dew al his
boockes &amp; recknynges payd’. This amount is precisely made up of the
30<i>s.</i> due on 24 June and the sums paid on account of these three
plays. By 22 October Chettle had completed <i>2 Brute</i> and managed
somehow to get £6 for it in full. On the same day he gave Henslowe an
acknowledgement of a debt, not of £8 9<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, but of £9
9<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> In November he got an earnest of £1 for <i>Tis
no Deceit to Deceive the Deceiver</i>, and £1 for ‘mending’ <i>Robin
Hood</i>, and in January 1599 30<i>s.</i> ‘to paye his charges in
the Marshallsey’. Small loans of a shilling or two are also noted
in the margin of the book, and appear to be quite distinct from the
company’s account with him, and to indicate private generosities of
Henslowe. In February 1599 Chettle had finished <i>Polyphemus</i>,
and it is recorded that in full payment of £6 he got £2 10<i>s.</i>
down, ‘&amp; strocken of his deatte which he owes vnto the companey fyftye
shelenges more’. A separate entry in the diary indicates that he paid
off yet another 10<i>s.</i> out of his fee for <i>The Spencers</i>
in March.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Material is not available for the further tracing of
this particular chain of transactions, but the inference that credit
obtained for an unfinished play had sometimes to be redeemed out of
the profits of a finished one is irresistible. Chettle, at least, does
not seem to have been hardly treated, but obviously the unbusinesslike
methods of the playwrights kept down the price of plays, and a familiar
device of the modern Barabbas was anticipated when Henry Porter was
obliged, on the receipt of an earnest, to give Henslowe ‘his faythfulle
promysse that I shold haue alle the boockes which he writte ether him
sellfe or with any other’.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Whatever Henslowe’s precise financial
relations with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> company may have been, by the way, he seems to
have been in a position to pose as paymaster, so far as the poets were
concerned.</p>

<p>On the whole, I think it must be concluded that, if the diary fails
to record payments to the amount of at least £5 for a new play,
there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that that play never got itself
finished. Occasionally, of course, apparently incomplete payments may
be explained by the fact that the same play is entered under more than
one name. Occasionally, also, a particular play may have been tacitly
debited with payments not specifically expressed in the diary to have
been made in respect of that play. Thus a sum of £2 paid on 4 February
1598 ‘to dise charge Mr. Dicker owt of the cownter in the Powltrey’
was probably treated as an instalment of the price of <i>Phaethon</i>
on which Dekker was then working, and for which otherwise only £4 is
entered. Another sum of £3 10<i>s.</i> paid on 30 January 1599 ‘to
descarge Thomas Dickers frome the a reaste of my lord Chamberlens men’
seems similarly to have gone towards <i>The First Introduction of
the Civil Wars of France</i>. And Haughton probably got 10<i>s.</i>
less than he would otherwise have done for <i>Ferrex and Porrex</i>,
because he had required a loan of that amount on 10 March 1600, ‘to
releace him owt of the Clyncke’.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The record, again, for a few
plays is most likely rendered imperfect by the loss of a leaf or two
from the manuscript, which once contained entries for the end of April
and beginning of May 1599.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> When these factors have been taken
into consideration, the resultant total of possibly unfinished plays
is not a very large one, amounting for 1597–1600 on my calculation to
not more than twenty as against fifty-six new plays duly completed and
paid for in full. Of these twenty it is very likely that some were in
fact finished, either for other companies, or for the Admiral’s men
themselves, later than the period covered by the diary. It is, however,
consonant with the literary temperament to suppose that some at least
remained within the category of unrealized projects. The most puzzling
problem is that of Haughton’s <i>A Woman will have her Will</i>. For
this it is impossible to trace payments beyond £2 10<i>s.</i>, and
these are not stated to be in full. Yet the play is not only now extant
but was certainly extant in 1598. In this case I see no alternative to
Dr. Greg’s theory of direct payments by the company.</p>

<p>Henslowe’s notes of advances to authors are not the sole material
which is available for drawing up an account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> the repertory of the
Admiral’s men. There are also entries of the purchase of costumes
and properties for certain plays, and of fees for the licensing of
plays by the Master of the Revels. And there is a valuable series of
inventories, formerly preserved at Dulwich, and dating from 1598, which
record respectively the stock of apparel and properties in the hands of
the Admiral’s men during the second week of March, their play-books at
the same date, and the additions made out of Henslowe’s purchases up
to about the following August.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The theory that some of the plays
recorded in the diary were never finished receives confirmation from
the absence of any corroborative proof of their existence in these
subsidiary entries and documents, whereas such evidence exists in
the case of a very large proportion of the plays for which the diary
records payment in full. It must not, however, be assumed, either that
every play completed necessarily got produced, although it is not
likely that many were withheld, or that a play was necessarily not
produced, because no special apparel or properties were bought for it,
since it may have been quite possible to mount some plays out of the
company’s existing stock. The number of fees paid for licensing is so
small in proportion to the number of plays certainly produced, that
these fees cannot all be supposed to have passed through Henslowe’s
hands.</p>

<p>Subject to the difficulties discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, I
think that the following is a fairly accurate account of the repertory
of the company for the three years now in question.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> During 1597–8
they purchased seventeen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> new plays. These, with the names of their
authors, were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Mother Redcap</i> (Drayton and Munday).</li>
  <li><i>Phaethon</i> (Dekker).</li>
  <li><i>1 Robin Hood</i> (Munday).</li>
  <li><i>2 Robin Hood</i> (Chettle and Munday).</li>
  <li><i>The Triangle of Cuckolds</i> (Dekker).<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>The Welshman’s Prize</i>, or, <i>The Famous Wars of Henry I and the Prince of Wales</i> (Chettle, Dekker, and Drayton).<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>1 Earl Godwin and his Three Sons</i> (Chettle, Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>2 Earl Godwin and his Three Sons</i> (Chettle, Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson).</li>
  <li><i>King Arthur</i> (Hathway).</li>
  <li><i>Love Prevented</i> (Porter).<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></li>
  <li><i>A Woman will have her Will</i> (Haughton).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>1 Black Bateman of the North</i> (Chettle, Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson).</li>
  <li><i>2 Black Bateman of the North</i> (Chettle and Wilson).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>The Madman’s Morris</i> (Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>The Funeral of Richard Cœur de Lion</i> (Chettle, Drayton, Munday, and Wilson).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>Hannibal and Hermes</i> (Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson).<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></li>
  <li><i>Valentine and Orson</i> (Hathway and Munday).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is evidence of the actual performance of <i>Mother Redcap</i>,
<i>Phaethon</i> (January), <i>1 and 2 Robin Hood</i> (March), <i>1 Earl
Godwin</i> (April), <i>King Arthur</i> (May), <i>2 Earl Godwin</i>
(June), <i>1 Black Bateman</i> (June). Properties were bought for
<i>The Madman’s Morris</i> in July, and the next season probably opened
with it. To the new plays must be added <i>Friar Spendleton</i>,
produced as ‘ne’ on 31 October, and <i>Dido and Aeneas</i>. A loan
of 30<i>s.</i> on 8 January ‘when they fyrst played Dido at nyght’
suggests a supper, not a night performance. Either play may have been
purchased at the end of 1596–7, or may have come from Pembroke’s stock.
The same applies to <i>Branholt</i> and <i>Alice Pierce</i>, which
were probably new when properties were purchased for them in November
and December. The company also bought on 12 December two jigs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> from
two young men, for which they paid 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Hardly any of
the 1597–8 new plays are extant. The two parts of <i>Robin Hood</i>
are <i>The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntingdon</i>, and <i>The Death
of Robert Earl of Huntingdon</i>, printed without Munday’s name as
Admiral’s plays in 1601. Haughton’s <i>A Woman will have her Will</i>
was entered on the Stationers’ Register on 3 August 1601, and printed
with the alternative title of <i>Englishmen for my Money</i> in 1616.
<i>Phaethon</i> probably underlies Dekker and Ford’s <i>The Sun’s
Darling</i>, and it is a plausible conjecture of Mr. Fleay’s that
<i>Love Prevented</i> may be <i>1 The Two Angry Women of Abingdon</i>,
printed as an Admiral’s play in 1599, and not to be traced elsewhere
in the diary. The payments for four plays during the year, besides the
puzzling <i>A Woman will have her Will</i>, were incomplete. I take it
that the £2 paid to Chettle, Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson for <i>Pierce
of Exton</i> was transferred to the account for <i>2 Earl Godwin</i>,
which otherwise lacks just that amount of the full £6; that Chettle
failed to deliver <i>A Woman’s Tragedy</i>; that Chapman’s <i>Isle of a
Woman</i> was held over until 1598–9; and that a projected tragedy of
Ben Jonson’s was similarly held over, and then indefinitely postponed
owing to the tragedy in real life of Spencer’s death. There are two
entries with regard to this. On 3 December 1597, Henslowe lent Jonson
20<i>s.</i> ‘vpon a boocke which he showed the plotte vnto the company
which he promysed to deliver vnto the company at Cryssmas next’. On 23
October 1598, a month after the duel, not Jonson, but Chapman, received
£3 ‘one his playe boocke &amp; ij ectes of a tragedie of Bengemenes
plotte’. I think that Chapman’s own play was <i>The Four Kings</i>
and that he finished it in 1599; but I see no sign that he ever did
anything with ‘Bengemenes plotte’.</p>

<p>Of older plays the Admiral’s revived at the beginning of the year
Chapman’s success of the previous spring, <i>The Comedy of Humours</i>;
also the perennial <i>Dr. Faustus</i>, and two pieces which, as they
formed no part of the 1594–7 repertory, may have been brought in by
Pembroke’s men, <i>Hardicanute</i> and <i>Bourbon</i>. They bought
for £8 from Martin Slater <i>1 and 2 Hercules</i>, <i>Phocas</i>,
<i>Pythagoras</i>, and <i>Alexander and Lodowick</i>, all of which had
been produced between May 1595 and January 1597, and had evidently been
retained by Slater when he left the company. These books presumably
do not include that which became the subject of the lawsuit between
Slater and the Admiral’s men, and as they had afterwards to buy back
some of their old books in a precisely similar way from Alleyn, it
is probable that a retiring member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> of the company had a right to
claim a partition of the repertory. They also bought <i>The Cobler of
Queenhithe</i>,<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> and from Robert Lee, formerly of the Admiral’s
men and afterwards of Queen Anne’s, <i>The Miller</i>. But of these
seven purchased plays, the only one that they can be proved to have
revived is one of the <i>Hercules</i> plays, for which they bought
properties in July. The book-inventory shows that they had plays
called <i>Black Joan</i> and <i>Sturgflattery</i>,<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> also possibly
from Pembroke’s stock; and the property-inventories that they had
properties and clothes, if not in all cases books,<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> for <i>The
Battle of Alcazar</i><a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> and for a number of pieces staged during
1594–7, including <i>Mahomet</i>,<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> <i>Tamburlaine</i>,<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> <i>The
Jew of Malta</i>,<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> <i>1 Fortunatus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> <i>The Siege of
London</i>,<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> <i>Belin Dun</i>,<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> <i>Tasso’s Melancholy</i>,<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
<i>1 Caesar and Pompey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> <i>The Wise Man of West
Chester</i>,<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> <i>The Set at Maw</i>,<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> <i>Olympo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
<i>Henry V</i>,<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> <i>Longshanks</i>,<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> <i>Troy</i>,<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
<i>Vortigern</i>,<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> <i>Guido</i>,<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> <i>Uther Pendragon</i>.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
To these must be added <i>Pontius Pilate</i>,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> revived in 1601 and
perhaps from the Pembroke’s stock, and others now unidentifiable.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
As the company revived <i>The Blind Beggar of Alexandria</i> in 1601

</ul>

<p>The property and licence entries only make it possible to trace the
actual performance during the year of <i>Pierce of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> Winchester</i>
(October), <i>1 and 2 Civil Wars of France</i> (October and November),
<i>The Fount of New Fashions</i> (November), <i>2 Angry Women
of Abingdon</i> (February), <i>2 Conquest of Brute</i> (March),
<i>The Four Kings</i> (March), <i>The Spencers</i> (April), and
<i>Agamemnon</i> (June). Probably, in view of the extant fragment of
a ‘plot’ <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> should be added. The production
of <i>Troy’s Revenge</i> was deferred until the following October.
No one of this year’s new plays is extant, unless, as is possible,
<i>All Fools but the Fool</i> was an early form of Chapman’s <i>All
Fools</i>.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Earnests were paid in the course of 1598–9 for
<i>Catiline’s Conspiracy</i> (Chettle), <i>Tis no Deceit to Deceive
the Deceiver</i> (Chettle), <i>William Longsword</i><a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> (Drayton),
<i>Two Merry Women of Abingdon</i> (Porter), and an unnamed pastoral
tragedy by Chapman, but there is no reason to suppose that any one of
these was ever finished. On 9 August 1598 Munday had 10s. in earnest
of an unnamed comedy ‘for the corte’ and Drayton gave his word for
the book to be done in a fortnight, but the project must have been
dropped, as the entry was cancelled. Of old plays the company revived
in August <i>Vayvode</i>, in November <i>The Massacre at Paris</i>,
in which Bird played the Guise,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> in December <i>1 The Conquest
of Brute</i>, bought from John Day, and in March <i>Alexander and
Lodowick</i>, bought from Martin Slater in the preceding year. As to
<i>Vayvode</i>, the entries are rather puzzling. In August Chettle
received £1 ‘for his playe of Vayvode’, and the purchase of properties
show that the production took place. But in the following January
there was a payment of £2 to Alleyn ‘for the playe of Vayvod for the
company’. Possibly Alleyn had some rights in the manuscript, which
were at first overlooked. On 25 November Chettle had 10<i>s.</i> ‘for
mendinge of Roben Hood for the corte’. Either <i>1</i> or <i>2</i>
<i>Robin Hood</i> was therefore probably the play given on 6 January
1599. At the beginning of the year the company bought <i>Mulmutius
Dunwallow</i> from William Rankins and another old play called
<i>Tristram of Lyons</i>, but it must be uncertain whether they played
them. A reference in Guilpin’s <i>Skialetheia</i> suggests that <i>The
Spanish Tragedy</i> may have been on the boards of the Rose not long
before September 1598.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span></p>

<p>It is possible to verify the actual performance of <i>Page of
Plymouth</i> (September), <i>1 Sir John Oldcastle</i> (November),<a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
Fortunatus (December), <i>The Gentle Craft</i> (January), <i>Thomas
Merry</i> (January), <i>Patient Grissell</i> (January), <i>2 Sir John
Oldcastle</i> (March), <i>The Seven Wise Masters</i> (March), <i>Ferrex
and Porrex</i> (May), <i>Damon and Pythias</i> (May), <i>Strange News
out of Poland</i> (May), <i>Cupid and Psyche</i> (June). <i>Sir John
Oldcastle</i> must of course be regarded as a counterblast to the
<i>Henry IV</i> plays of the Chamberlain’s men, in which the character
of Falstaff originally bore the name of the Lollard hero. One infers
that it had a considerable success, for the company gave 10s. for
‘Mr. Mundaye and the reste of the poets at the playnge of Sr John
Oldcastell the ferste tyme’, and Henslowe notes in the margin that
this was ‘as a gefte’. It is with some hesitation that I have included
<i>Fortunatus</i> in the list of new plays, because it is impossible
to suppose that it was not based upon the earlier <i>Fortunatus</i>,
already an old play in 1596, of the properties of which the Admiral’s
men certainly retained possession. But Dekker was paid on the scale
of a new play, for he got a full £6 in the course of November for
the book, together with an additional £1 ‘for the altrenge of the
boocke’ and £2 a fortnight later ‘for the eande of Fortewnatus for
the corte’. I take it that this was the Court play of 27 December.
That of 1 January was another of Dekker’s, <i>The Gentle Craft</i>,
also called <i>The Shoemaker’s Holiday</i>, which was published in
the year ‘1600’ as played before the Queen ‘on New Year’s Day at
night last’ by the Admiral’s men. <i>Fortunatus</i>, <i>1 Sir John
Oldcastle</i>,<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> <i>Patient Grissell</i>, and
<i>1 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i> have also been preserved, while
the publication, also in the course of the twelve months ending on 24
March 1601, of <i>Look About You</i> as an Admiral’s play must surely
render plausible the hypothesis, rejected by Dr. Greg, of its identity
with <i>Bear a Brain</i>. It would seem that <i>Thomas Merry</i>
furnishes one of the two parallel plots of Robert Yarington’s <i>Two
Lamentable Tragedies</i>, and a notice by Simon Forman suggests that
<i>Cox of Collumpton</i> was ultimately finished.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> An outline of
the opening scenes of <i>2 Henry Richmond</i> is among the Dulwich
papers.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Publication was a form of popularity which the actors
were apt to resent. The Admiral’s men spent £2 on 18 March 1600 ‘to
geue vnto the printer to staye the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> printing of Patient Gresell’. This
did not prevent the play being entered on the Stationers’ Register on
28 March, but does perhaps explain why the earliest known edition is
dated 1603. The unfinished plays of 1599–1600 were <i>The Poor Man’s
Paradise</i> (Haughton), <i>The Orphans’ Tragedy</i> (Chettle),<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
an unnamed Italian tragedy by Day, <i>The Arcadian Virgin</i> (Chettle
and Haughton), <i>Owen Tudor</i> (Drayton, Hathway, Munday, and
Wilson), <i>Truth’s Supplication to Candlelight</i> (Dekker),<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
<i>The Spanish Moor’s Tragedy</i> (Day, Dekker, and Haughton),<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
<i>The English Fugitives</i> (Haughton), <i>The Devil and his Dame</i>
(Haughton),<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> <i>The Wooing of Death</i> (Chettle), <i>Judas</i>
(Haughton),<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> <i>2 Fair Constance of Rome</i> (Hathway), and
an unnamed play by Chettle and Day.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Except in so far as
<i>Fortunatus</i> was an old play, I find no trace of a revival during
1599–1600, but it may be assumed that some of the productions of the
last two years still held the boards.</p>

<p>The year 1600 was another turning-point in the history of the company.
Probably at some date between 14 August, when the first entry in a
fresh account was made, and 28 October, when Pembroke’s men were in
occupation of the Rose, they crossed the river, and took up their
quarters at Alleyn’s recently built Fortune, on the north-west boundary
of the City. A more important event still was the return of Alleyn
himself to the stage, from which he had been absent for three years.
It is suggested in the Privy Council letter of 8 April 1600 to the
Middlesex justices in favour of the Fortune project, that this step was
determined by the personal wish of the Queen to see the great actor at
Court with his fellows again.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> It is not quite clear on what terms
he rejoined the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> company. There was a ‘composicion’ or agreement, in
connexion with which a payment of £4 was made to him on 11 November.
The next entry, which is undated, runs, ‘P<sup>d</sup> vnto my sonne Alleyn for
the firste weckes playe the xj parte of xvij<sup>ll</sup> ix<sup>s</sup> which came to
therti &amp; ij shellinges’. There are no further entries of the same
kind until the date of a reckoning in February 1602, when Henslowe
paid Alleyn 27<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> ‘dew to my sone out of the gallery
money’. Probably this was a share of some small residue, the origin of
which cannot now be traced. The earlier payment suggests that Alleyn
received one full share of the actors’ takings, for, if I am right in
supposing that the brothers Jeffes only held half a share each, there
would have been just ten sharers besides himself. Or possibly his share
may have been limited to the actors’ moiety of the gallery takings,
and the outgoings may all have been charged to the receipts from the
yard. Certainly Alleyn does not seem to have had any responsibility for
these outgoings. His name is never put with those of other sharers to
Henslowe’s periodical reckonings, and if his play-books were used, they
were bought from him. On the other hand, he sometimes, although not so
often as some of his fellows, ‘appointed’ payments, and he received the
Court money for the company, alike in 1601, 1602, and 1603. That his
share did not pass through Henslowe’s hands after the date of the first
instalment is perhaps explained by the assumption that, as the owner
and joint occupier with Henslowe of the Fortune, the appointment of a
‘gatherer’ for the gallery money may naturally have fallen to him.</p>

<p>Some such change in the financial arrangements may also account for the
fact that, while Henslowe’s record of advances continues on the same
lines as that for 1597–1600, the notes of weekly repayments are now
discontinued. As a result it is no longer possible to determine with
any exactness the length of the theatrical seasons, since, naturally
enough, the outgoings did not altogether stop while the house was
closed. Their course, however, suggests intervals in February and March
1601, February to April 1602, August 1602 and January and February
1603. It is possible, although not very likely, that there was no
cessation of playing during the summer of 1601. I find no evidence of
further provincial travels before the end of the reign. These were, I
think, years of prosperity. The players still required small personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
advances from time to time, and Thomas Towne was reduced to pawning
a pair of stockings on 13 March 1602.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> But it is noticeable that
about the previous June Henslowe opened an account under the heading,
‘Begininge to receue of thes meane ther privet deates which they
owe vnto me’, and was able to enter in it a series of repayments by
Jones, Downton, Bird, and Shaw.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Bird, however, still owed £10
10<i>s.</i> on 12 March 1602, and Henslowe noted, ‘He is cleere of all
debtes &amp; demaundes except theis debtes and such stocke &amp; covenentes as
I maie clayme &amp; challendge of him by reason of his coniunction with
the companie’.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Whether the playwrights reaped any benefit may be
doubted. The tendency to a rise of prices which showed itself in 1599
was hardly maintained. Some of them were still impecunious enough.
The company had, on more than one occasion to redeem a play which the
unfortunate Chettle had pawned with one Bromfield, a mercer; and in
March 1602 he seems to have followed Porter’s example and put his hand,
for a consideration of £3, to an instrument binding him to write for
them alone.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> There were some legal troubles in the course of 1601.
A sum of £21 10<i>s.</i> had to be paid on a bond to a Mr. Treheren
during March, and in August there were fees to a jury and a clerk of
assizes. The company had also to find 10<i>s.</i> in May ‘to geatte
the boye into the ospetalle which was hurt at the Fortewne’.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
Information as to the composition of the company at some time between
Alleyn’s return and February 1602 is given by the ‘plot’ of <i>The
Battle of Alcazar</i>, although, as this is mutilated, it must not be
treated as negative evidence, and in particular the names of W. Borne
and John Singer are missing.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> All the other sharers, however, are
found in it&mdash;‘Mr. Ed. Allen, Mr. Doughton, Mr. Juby, Mr. Shaa, Mr.
Jones, Mr. Towne, Antony Jeffes, H. Jeffes, Mr. Charles [Massey],
and Mr. Sam [Rowley]’. There are also Mr. Rich. Allen and Mr. Hunt,
who were not sharers, but whose long service had apparently earned
them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> dignity of the ‘Mr.’, W. Kendall, Jeames, who was possibly
Henslowe’s apprentice James Bristow and possibly Jones’s boy of the
same name, and Dob, who was probably the Dobe of the 1598 inventory.
The remaining names, all of which are new, are those of W. Cartwright,
who, however, had witnessed a loan for Henslowe as far back as 21
April 1598,<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Dick Jubie, Ro. Tailor, George Somerset, Tho. Drum,
[Thomas] Parsons, Harry, and the ‘boys’ of Mr. Allen and Mr. Towne. The
only important woman’s part, that of Callipolis, is assigned by the
‘plot’ to Pisano, which does not look like an actor’s name and may be a
mistake. The services of Bristow were evidently leased out by Henslowe
to the company or some one of its members, at a rate of 3<i>s.</i> a
week. Antony Jeffes paid two weeks’ arrears ‘for my boyes Jeames wages’
in August 1600, and Henslowe charged the company £6 10<i>s.</i> on the
same account in the following February.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Another boy attached to
the company about the same time must have been ‘Nick’, for whom hose
‘to tumbell in be fore the quen’ were bought on 25 December 1601. Hugh
Davis, for the mending of whose tawny coat ‘which was eatten with the
rattes’ 6<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> was paid in November 1601, was perhaps a
hired man. A list of the responsible members of the company is attached
by Henslowe to a reckoning cast between 7 and 23 February 1602. They
were then ‘John Singer, Thomas Downton, William Byrd, Edward Juby,
Thomas Towne, Humphrey Jeffs, Anthony Jeffs, Samuel Rowley, and Charles
Massy’.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> A note is added that £50 had been advanced ‘to geve vnto
Mr. Jonnes &amp; Mr. Shaw at ther goinge a waye’. This departure must have
been quite recent. Shaw had been agent for the company on the previous
21 January, and the list of continuing members is in fact in his
handwriting. The last instalment of Jones’s private debt had been paid
off on 1 November. His three years’ agreement with Henslowe had expired
at Michaelmas 1600. Richard Alleyn must have died in September 1602,
for on the 19th of that month his widow borrowed £5 10<i>s.</i> to take
her mantle and sheet and face-cloth out of pawn.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Neither Shaw nor
Jones nor Richard Alleyn is in the plot of <i>1 Tamar Cham</i>, which
may reasonably be assigned to a date in the vicinity of the purchase
of the book from Alleyn on 2 October 1602. This is of interest, partly
because it is complete, and partly because there was a procession
in the play, and the number of supernumeraries required must have
tried the resources<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> of the establishment to their utmost. All the
principal members of the company appeared&mdash;‘Mr. Allen, Mr. Denygten,
Mr. Boorne, Mr. Towne, Mr. Singer, Mr. Jubie, H. Jeffs, A. Jeffs, Mr.
Charles [Massey], and Mr. Sam [Rowley]’; and in addition Dick Jubie, W.
Cart[wright], George [Somerset], Tho. Parsons, and Jeames [Bristow],
who were in <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, and W. Parr, Tho. Marbeck,
Jack Grigorie, Gedion, Gibbs, Tho. Rowley, Rester, ‘old Browne’, Ned
Browne, ‘the red fast fellow’ and several boys, described, perhaps
in some cases twice over, as Jack Jones, ‘little Will’, ‘little
Will Barne’, who do not seem to be identical, ‘Gils his boy’, ‘Mr.
Denyghtens little boy’, perhaps the same already recorded in 1600,
and ‘the other little boy’. ‘Old Browne’ can hardly be Robert Browne,
who seems to have been in Germany; but Ned Browne may be the Edward
Browne who, like Robert, was a member of Worcester’s company in 1583.
Little is added by the only other extant ‘plot’, the fragmentary one of
<i>2 Fortune’s Tennis</i>. This is difficult to date, but it must be
later than Dekker’s <i>1 Fortune’s Tennis</i> of September 1600, and
may not improbably be Munday’s <i>Set at Tennis</i> of December 1602.
The few names which it contains&mdash;Mr. Singer, Sam, Charles, Geo[rge
Somerset], R. Tailor, W. Cartwright, Pavy&mdash;suggest proximity to <i>The
Battle of Alcazar</i> and <i>1 Tamar Cham</i>. The only fresh one is
that of Pavy, who may or may not be connected with the Salathiel Pavy
of Ben Jonson’s epitaph. Both <i>1 Tamar Cham</i> and <i>2 Fortune’s
Tennis</i> must be earlier than January 1603, a month which saw the
retirement of the old Queen’s man, John Singer. So at least may be
inferred from the fact that he makes no further appearance in the diary
after 13 January, when he received £5 ‘for his play called Syngers
Vallentarey’. I take ‘vallentarey’ to mean ‘valediction’. His name
is absent from the next list of the company, which belongs to 1604.
He probably left to become an ordinary Groom of the Chamber in the
royal household, a post which he is found occupying at the time of
Elizabeth’s funeral.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>The succession of new plays was not quite so rapid during 1600–3 as
in previous periods. I can only trace thirty-one in all, as against
fifty-five in 1594–7 and sixty-two in 1599–1600. It may well have
been the case that Alleyn, who had ‘created’ parts in the ’eighties
and early ’nineties, had a tendency towards revivals. For 1600–1 the
company bought only seven new books. These were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>1 Fortune’s Tennis</i> (Dekker).</li>
  <li><i>Hannibal and Scipio</i> (Hathway and Rankins).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span></li>
  <li><i>Scogan and Skelton</i> (Hathway and Rankins).</li>
  <li><i>All is not Gold that Glisters</i> (Chettle).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>2 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i> (Day and Haughton).</li>
  <li><i>The Six Yeomen of the West</i> (Day and Haughton).</li>
  <li><i>King Sebastian of Portugal</i> (Chettle and Dekker).</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these plays is extant, but the purchase of properties testifies
to the performance of <i>2 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i> in April
and <i>The Six Yeomen of the West</i> in July. Moreover, Day received a
bonus of 10<i>s.</i> between 27 April and 2 May ‘after the playinge of’
the former piece. Only £1 was paid for <i>1 Fortune’s Tennis</i>, but
the existence of a ‘plot’ for <i>2 Fortune’s Tennis</i> suggests that
it must have been completed. Probably it was a short topical overture
designed to celebrate the opening of the Fortune.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Unfinished
plays were <i>Robin Hood’s Pennyworths</i> (Haughton)<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and <i>The
Conquest of Spain by John of Gaunt</i> (Hathway and Rankins). The
revivals included <i>Phaethon</i> (January), <i>The Blind Beggar of
Alexandria</i> (May), and <i>The Jew of Malta</i> (May). Dekker had
£2 for ‘alterynge of’ <i>Phaethon</i> for the Court, and this was
therefore the Admiral’s play of 6 January 1601. They also appeared
on 28 December and 2 February. <i>Dr. Faustus</i> was entered on 7
January; the earliest print (1604) bears their name. The new books of
1601–2 were fourteen in number, as follows:<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<ul>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>The Conquest of the West Indies</i> (Day, Haughton, and Smith).</li>

<p>At least ten of these appear to have been played: <i>2 Cardinal
Wolsey</i> (August), <i>3 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>
(September), <i>Judas</i> (January), <i>The Conquest of the West
Indies</i> (January), <i>Malcolm King of Scots</i> (April), <i>Love

<i>Jephthah</i> (July), and at uncertain dates, <i>Tobias</i> and
probably <i>The Bristol Tragedy</i>.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> None is now extant. The
unfinished plays were <i>The Humorous Earl of Gloucester with his
Conquest of Portugal</i> (Wadeson), <i>2 Tom Dough</i><a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> (Day and

Wife</i> (Dekker).<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> There was considerable activity of revival
during the year. Six old plays belonging to the 1594–7 repertory,
for some of which the company already held the properties,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> were
bought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> from Alleyn at £2 each, <i>Mahomet</i> in August, <i>The Wise
Man of West Chester</i> in September, <i>Vortigern</i> in November,
and <i>The French Doctor</i>, <i>The Massacre at Paris</i>, and
<i>Crack Me this Nut</i> in January. The first and the last three
of these certainly were played, and the revival of <i>The Massacre
at Paris</i> appears to have caused annoyance to Henri IV.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> In
addition, properties were bought for one of the <i>Hercules</i> plays
in December, Dekker got 10<i>s.</i> for a prologue and epilogue to
<i>Pontius Pilate</i><a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> in January, and Jonson wrote additions to
<i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, possibly those now extant, in September,
although it may be doubted whether the further additions contemplated
in the following June were ever made. There is nothing to show what was
selected, other than Nick’s tumbling, for the Admiral’s only Court play
of 1601–2, which took place on 27 December.</p>

<p>The season of 1602–3 was, of course, shortened by the death of
Elizabeth and the outbreak of plague. The new plays numbered nine. They
were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Samson</i> (Anon.).</li>
  <li><i>Felmelanco</i> (Chettle and Robinson).</li>
  <li><i>Joshua</i> (Rowley).</li>
  <li><i>Randal Earl of Chester</i> (Middleton).</li>
  <li><i>Merry as May Be</i> (Day, Hathway, and Smith).</li>
  <li><i>The Set at Tennis</i> (Munday).</li>
  <li><i>1 The London Florentine</i> (Chettle and Heywood).</li>
  <li><i>Singer’s Voluntary</i> (Singer).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>The Boss of Billingsgate</i> (Day, Hathway, and another).<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It must be added that in September properties were bought for a ‘new
playe’ called <i>The Earl of Hertford</i>, which it seems impossible
to identify with any of the pieces bought. This looks like one of the
rare cases in which payment did not pass through Henslowe’s hands.
This and <i>Samson</i> are the only new plays of the year, the actual
performance of which can be verified; and none of these plays is
extant.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> I suspect, however, that Munday’s <i>Set at Tennis</i> is
the <i>2 Fortune’s Tennis</i> of which a ‘plot’ survives. The payment,
of only £3, was ‘in full’, and it may, like <i>1 Fortune’s Tennis</i>,
have been a short piece of some exceptional character, motived by
the name of the theatre in which it was presented. Unfinished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> plays
at the end of the season were <i>The Widow’s Charm</i> (Munday or
Wadeson),<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> <i>William Cartwright</i> (Haughton), <i>Hoffman</i>
(Chettle),<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> <i>2 London Florentine</i> (Chettle and Heywood),
<i>The Siege of Dunkirk and Alleyn the Pirate</i> (Massey). The
revival of old plays continued. Costumes for <i>Vortigern</i>, one of
those bought from Alleyn in the previous year, were in preparation
during September, and Alleyn’s stock yielded three more, <i>Philip
of Spain</i> and <i>Longshanks</i> in August and <i>Tamar Cham</i>,
probably the second part, as the extant ‘plot’ testifies, in October.
The last two of these belonged to the Admiral’s repertory of 1594–7,
but the origin of <i>Philip of Spain</i> is unknown. A book of <i>The
Four Sons of Aymon</i>, for which £2 was paid to Robert Shaw, was
probably also old, and was bought on condition that Shaw should repay
the £2, unless the play was used by the Admiral’s or some other company
with his consent by Christmas 1604. Bird and Rowley had £4 in September
for additions to <i>Dr. Faustus</i>. Dekker completed some alterations
of <i>Tasso’s Melancholy</i>, another 1594–7 play, in December, and in
the same month Middleton wrote ‘for the corte’ a prologue and epilogue
to Greene’s <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, which I should suppose
to have been Henslowe’s property, as it was played by Strange’s men in
1592–3 and the Queen’s and Sussex’s in 1594. This probably served for
the first of the three appearances made by the Admiral’s at Court, on
27 December. The other two were on 6 March and on a date unspecified.
For one of these occasions Chettle was writing a prologue and epilogue
at the end of December, but the play is not named.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> One of the new
plays, <i>Merry as May Be</i>, was intended for Court, when the first
payment on account of it was made on 9 November.</p>

<p>On 12 March 1603 Henslowe practically closes the detailed record
which he had kept continuously in his diary since October 1597 of
his financial transactions, otherwise than by way of rent, with the
Admiral’s men. A brief review of these is not without interest.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
His advances from 21 October 1597 to 8 March 1598 amounted to £46
7<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, and to this he took the signatures of the
company, with the note, ‘Thes men dothe aknowlege this deat to be dewe
by them by seatynge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> of ther handes to yette’. By 28 July a further
amount of £120 15<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> had been incurred, making a
total of £166 17<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for 1597–8.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> During the
same period he entered weekly receipts from the company to a total
of £125. These must have gone to an old debt, for he did not balance
them with the payments for the year, but carried on the whole debit
of £166 17<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> to 1598–9. Apparently, however, he
was not satisfied with the way in which expenditure was outstripping
income, for he headed a new receipts account, ‘Here I begyne to receue
the wholle gallereys frome this daye beinge the 29 of July 1598’, and
the weekly entries become about double what they were during 1597–8.
On the other hand, there is also a considerable increase in the rate
of expenditure. It is an ingenious and, I think, sound conjecture of
Dr. Greg’s, that throughout 1594–1603 Henslowe was taking half the
gallery money for rent, and that, at different times, he also took
either the other half, or another quarter only, to recoup himself
for his advances.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> The outgoings entered during 1598–9 reach
£435 7<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, but some items for March and April 1599
are probably missing, owing to a mutilation of the manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
The receipts for the same period were £358 3<i>s.</i> On 13 October
1599, about a fortnight after the beginning of the 1599–1600 season,
a balance was struck. Henslowe credited the company with the £358
received from the gallery money, and debited them with £632 advanced
by him. This includes £166 17<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for 1597–8, £435
7<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for 1598–9, and £29 15<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, which
may reasonably be taken as the sum of the missing entries for March and
April 1599. The balance of £274 remained as a debt from the company.
They did not, however, set their hands to a reckoning until the end
of the next year, on 10 July 1600. During 1599–1600 a fresh account
had been running, on which Henslowe’s receipts were £202 10<i>s.</i>
and his payments £222 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> At the reckoning the
company’s indebtedness is calculated at £300, and is admitted by the
formula, ‘which some of three hundred powndes we whose names are here
vnder written doe acknowledge our dewe debt &amp; doe promyse payment’. To
this their signatures are appended. There is, however, an unexplained
discrepancy of £6 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> old debt of £274 and
the 1599–1600 debit balance of £19 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> only make up
£293 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>From 1600 onwards there are no records of receipts. A continuous
account of payments is kept up to 7 February 1602. The total amounts
to £304 10<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, but Henslowe sums it in error as
£308 6<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and notes, ‘Frome ther handes to this
place is 308<sup>ll</sup>-06<sup>s</sup>-04<sup>d</sup> dewe vnto me &amp; with the three hundred of
owld is £608-06-04<sup>d</sup>’. He then adds the £50 paid to Jones and Shaw
on retirement, ‘which is not in this recknynge’. Above this summary
comes a list of names, said by Dr. Greg to be in Shaw’s hand, of those
sharers who were continuing in the company, headed by the figures ‘211.
9. 0.’ I think the interpretation is that £386 17<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
of the £608 6<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> was paid out of gallery money or
other sources, leaving £211 9<i>s.</i>, together with the £50 for Jones
and Shaw, chargeable on the company. This is borne out by the remnant
of the accounts, which is headed, ‘Begininge with a new recknyng with
my lord of Notingames men the 23 daye of Febreary 1601 as foloweth’.
The expenditure on this new reckoning up to 12 March 1603 was, as
calculated by Henslowe, £188 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and he adds to
this total a sum of £211 9<i>s.</i> ‘vpon band’, being evidently the
residue of the debt as it stood at the close of the old reckoning, and
makes a total of £400 0<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> This, with the £50 for
Jones and Shaw, was no doubt what the company owed when the detailed
account in the diary closed. There was, however, an unstated amount
of gallery receipts during 1602–3 to set against it; and in fact a
retrospect of the whole series of figures shows that there would
have been a pretty fair equivalence of gallery money and advances
throughout, but for the exceptionally heavy expenditure of 1598–9, £465
2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> in all, which left the company saddled with an
obligation which they never quite overtook. This expenditure was more
than half the total expenditure of £854 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the
<i>triennium</i> 1597–1600, and nearly as much as the whole expenditure
of £493 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> for the <i>triennium</i> 1600–3, during
which it may be suspected that the business capacities of Alleyn
brought about considerable economies.</p>

<p>The accounts may be looked at from another point of view. If the
unanalysable sum of £29 15<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> for the missing items
of March and April 1599 be neglected, there was a total expenditure
for the six years of £1,317 11<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> Of this £652
13<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, being about half, went in payments in respect
of play-books; £561 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> for properties and apparel;
and £103 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in miscellaneous outgoings, such
as licensing fees, legal charges, musical instruments, travelling
expenses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span> merry-makings and the like. Thus, if the company supped
together at Mr. Mason’s of the Queen’s Head, or met to read a ‘book’
at the Sun in New Fish Street, Henslowe would put his hand into his
pocket to pay the score, and would not forget afterwards to debit the
company with the amount in his diary.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> It must, of course, be
borne in mind that only part of this miscellaneous expenditure was
incurred through Henslowe. He certainly did not, for example, pay all
the fees for the licensing of new plays by the Master of the Revels.
And of course there were many matters, in particular the wages of hired
actors and servitors, for which the company had regularly to find funds
in other ways. It is probable that only play-books, properties, and
apparel were normally charged to his account, although the convenience
of an occasional extension of his functions can readily be understood.
Dr. Greg may be right in thinking that his position as agent for the
company in its purchases was a natural development of his pawnbroking
business.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> But during the period under review he did not, as a
rule, supply them with goods himself. A sale of ‘A shorte velluett
clocke wraght with bugell &amp; a gearcken of velluet layd with brade
coper sylver lace’ for £4 on 28 November 1598 was exceptional. Usually
the payments are to tradesmen, to the mercers Stone, Richard Heath,
and Robert Bromfield, to ‘him at the Eagell and Chylld’ for armour,
to Mrs. Gosson for head-tires, and for wigs to one Father Ogle, who
is mentioned also in the Revels Accounts and in the play of <i>Sir
Thomas More</i>. Sometimes ready-made garments, new or second-hand,
were bought. A doublet and hose of sea-water green satin cost £3 and
a doublet and ‘venesyons’ of cloth of silver wrought with red silk
£4 10<i>s.</i> But often stuffs were obtained in piece and made up
by tailors, of whom the company employed two, Dover and Radford, the
latter known, for the sake of distinction, as ‘the little tailor’.
These and William White, who made the crowns, probably worked at the
theatre, in the tiring-house. The company gave 6<i>s.</i> a yard for
russet broadcloth and the same for murrey satin, 12<i>s.</i> for other
satins, 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for taffeties, and no less than £1 for
‘ij pylle velluet of carnardyn’. Laces cost 1<i>d.</i> each; copper
lace anything from 4<i>s.</i> a pound to 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> an
ounce. Of this they used quantities, and in the summer of 1601 they
had run up a considerable ‘old debt’ to the copper lace-man, as well
as another to Heath the mercer, which had to be paid off by degrees.
The more expensive garments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> such as a rich cloak bought of Langley
for £19, were, of course, an investment on the part of the company,
and were worn in their time by many sharers and hired men in different
parts. But the principal actors had also, as Alleyn’s inventory shows,
their private wardrobes. Henslowe was prepared to furnish these on the
instalment system. Thus Richard Jones bought in 1594 ‘a manes gowne of
pechecoler in grayne’ for £3 payable in weekly sums of 5<i>s.</i>, and
Thomas Towne in 1598 ‘a blacke clothe clocke layd with sylke lace’ for
26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> at 1<i>s.</i> weekly. It was as hard to keep
these glories as to procure them. On one occasion the company came to
the rescue and lent Thomas Downton £12 10<i>s.</i>, to fetch out of
pawn two cloaks, ‘which they exsepted into the stock’. The one was
‘ashecolerd velluet embradered with gowld’, the other ‘a longe black
velluet clocke layd with sylke lace’.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The termination of the record of advances after 12 March 1603 indicates
an interruption of performances, probably due to the increasing illness
of Elizabeth, who died on the following 24 March. Thereafter there
are only a few winding-up entries in the diary. The company must have
immediately begun to travel under the leadership of Thomas Downton, who
in the course of 1602–3 received a gift for them from the Corporation
of Canterbury, ‘because it was thought fitt they should not play at
all, in regard that our late Queene was then very sicke or dead as they
supposed’. London playing, if resumed at all, must have very soon been
stopped again by the plague. There was some further small expenditure,
of which the details are not given, before Henslowe noted that, in
addition to the bond for £211 9<i>s.</i>, ‘Ther reasteth dew vnto me
to this daye beinge the v daye of Maye 1603 when we leafte of playe
now at the Kynges cominge all recknynges abated the some of a hundred
fowerscore &amp; sevntenepowndes &amp; thirteneshellynges &amp; fowerpence I saye
dew&mdash;£197 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> the fyftye powndes which Jonnes &amp;
Shawe had at ther goinge a way not reconed’. The company travelled
again during the plague, being traceable as the Admiral’s men in
1602–3 at Bath and York and on 18 August 1603 at Leicester, and as the
Earl of Nottingham’s in 1602–3 at Coventry. The tour was over by 21
October, on which date Joan Alleyn wrote to her husband at the house
of Mr. Chaloner in Sussex, telling him amongst other things that ‘all
of your owne company ar well at theyr owne houses’, that all the other
companies had returned, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> ‘Nicke and Jeames be well’, and that
‘Browne of the Boares head’ had not gone into the country at all, and
was now dead, ‘&amp; dyed very pore’. This might be either Edward Browne,
or the ‘old Browne’ who appeared with him in <i>1 Tamar Cham</i> in the
previous autumn. In any case, it is clear from the reference to him
that he was not a regular member of Alleyn’s company. ‘Jeames’ is no
doubt James Bristow, who, as Henslowe’s apprentice, would be likely to
form part of his household; and ‘Nicke’, who seems to have been in the
same position, may be supposed to be the Nick who tumbled before the
Queen at Christmas 1601.</p>

<p>The Jacobean records of the company seem meagre in the absence of
Henslowe’s detailed register of proceedings. About Christmas 1603 they
were taken into the service of Prince Henry, and are hereafter known
as the Prince’s players.[535] They are entered amongst other ‘Officers
to the Prince’ as receiving four and a half yards of red cloth apiece
as liveries for the coronation procession on 15 March 1604, and
their names are given as ‘Edward Allen, William Bird, Thomas Towne,
Thomas Dowton, Samuell Rowley, Edward Jubie, Humfry Jeffes, Charles
Massey, and Anthony Jeffes’.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Alleyn, even if not a ‘sharer’,
was therefore a member of the company in its official capacity. He
is also named as the Prince’s servant, both in the printed account
of the entertainment at which, dressed as a Genius, he delivered a
speech, and in Stowe’s description of a bear-baiting which formed part
of the festivities.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> It may, however, be inferred that he took an
early opportunity of leaving a profession to which he had only been
recalled by the personal whim of the late Queen.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> He was joint
payee with Juby in the warrant of 19 February, but Juby’s name stands
alone in another of 17 April and in those of all subsequent years up
to 1615. And when the company received a formal licence by patent on
30 April 1606, Alleyn’s name was omitted, and does not appear in any
further list of its members. It is true that as late as 11 May 1611
he is still described in a formal document as the Prince’s servant,
but he may have held some other appointment, actual or honorific, in
the household.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> A note of his resources about 1605, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
includes ‘my share of aparell, £100’.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> And he certainly remained
interested in the company. They were his tenants at the Fortune,
although an unexecuted draft of a lease to Thomas Downton dated in
1608 suggests that he may have taken steps to transfer the whole or a
share of his direct interest to them. Under this lease Downton was to
receive during thirteen years a thirty-second part of the daily profits
accruing to Henslowe and Alleyn, and in return to pay £27 10<i>s.</i>,
a rent of 10<i>s.</i> annually and his proportionate share of repairs,
and to bind himself to play in the house and not elsewhere without
consent.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> On 11 April 1612 Robert Browne is found writing to Alleyn
on behalf of one Mr. Rose, lately ‘entertayned amongst the princes
men’, to request his interest as one ‘who he knowes can strike a greter
stroke amongst them then this’ to procure him a ‘gathering place’
for his wife.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Another letter from Bird to Alleyn, also about a
gatherer, is amusing enough to quote in full. It is undated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Sir there is one Jhon Russell, that by yowr apoyntment was made

<p>Between 1606 and 1610 it seems to have been thought desirable to
strengthen the composition of the company by the introduction of
new blood. A list of ‘Comedyanes and Playores’, included in the
establishment book drawn up when Henry formed his own Household as
Prince of Wales in 1610, contains six names in addition to the eight
of the patent.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> They are ‘Edward Colbrande, Wm. Parre, Rychard
Pryore, William Stratford, Frauncys Grace, and John Shanke’. Of these
William Parr, who is in the plot of <i>1 Tamar Cham</i> in 1602, is
alone traceable in the earlier records of the company. Shank had been
of Pembroke’s and Queen Elizabeth’s men.</p>

<p>Henslowe entered two more advances in his diary, one for ‘facynge
of a blacke grogren clocke with taffytye’, the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> to Dekker and
Middleton in earnest of <i>The Patient Man and the Honest Whore</i>.
This was entered in the Stationers’ Register on 9 November 1604, and
printed as <i>The Honest Whore</i> during the year. The name of Towne
is in a stage-direction. On 14 March ‘1604’, which may have been
either 1604 or 1605, Henslowe had a final reckoning with the company
and noted ‘Caste vp all the acowntes frome the begininge of the world
vntell this daye beinge the 14 daye of Marche 1604 by Thomas Dowghton
&amp; Edward Jube for the company of the prynces men &amp; I Phillipe Henslow
so ther reasteth dew vnto me P Henslow the some of xxiiij<sup>li</sup> all
reconynges consernynge the company in stocke generall descarged &amp; my
sealfe descarged to them of al deates’.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> With this, so far as the
extant book goes, the record of his transactions with the company
practically ceases. The only exception is a note of receipts at the
Fortune during the three days next after Christmas in 1608, which
amounted to 25<i>s.</i>, 45<i>s.</i>, and 44<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
respectively.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Something of the career of the Prince’s men may
be gleaned from other sources. They played at Court before James on
21 January and 20 February 1604, and before Henry on 4, 15, and 22
January; and during the following Christmas before Anne on 23 November
1604 and before Henry on 24 November, 14 and 19 December, and on 15
and 22 January and 5 and 19 February 1605. On 8 February 1605 their
play of <i>Richard Whittington</i>, of which nothing further is known,
was entered on the Stationers’ Register.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> In the same year Samuel
Rowley’s <i>When You See Me, You Know Me</i>, was printed as played
by them. During the Christmas of 1605–6 they gave three plays before
James and three before Henry.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> In 1604–5 they were at Maidstone
and Winchester, in 1605–6 at Bath, on 17 July 1606 at Oxford, and on
17 October at Ipswich. During the Christmas of 1606–7 they gave six
plays before James. Dekker’s <i>Whore of Babylon</i> was entered on
the Stationers’ Register on 20 April 1607 and printed as theirs in
the same year. In 1606–7 they were at Bath. During the Christmas of
1607–8 they gave four plays before James and Henry. In 1607–8 they
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> at Maidstone and Saffron Walden, and on 1 October 1608 they were
at Leicester; but a visit of the same year from ‘the Princes players
of the White Chapple, London’ is rather to be assigned to the Duke of
York’s men (q.v.). They gave three plays before James and Henry during
the Christmas of 1608–9, four before James during that of 1609–10, and
four before James during that of 1610–11. Middleton and Dekker’s <i>The
Roaring Girl</i> was printed in 1611 as lately played by them at the
Fortune, and Field’s <i>Amends for Ladies</i> (<i>c.</i> 1610–11) names
‘Long Meg and the Ship’ as in their repertory. Presumably their <i>Long
Meg of Westminster</i> of 1595 still held the boards.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> In 1608–9
they were at Shrewsbury and Saffron Walden, in 1609–10 at Shrewsbury
and Hereford, in 1610–11 at Shrewsbury and Winchester.</p>

<p>They played at Court before James on 28 and 29 December 1611, giving
on the second night <i>The Almanac</i>, and before Henry in February
and Elizabeth in April 1612. On 1 October 1612 the lewd jigs, songs,
and dances at the Fortune are recited in an order of the Middlesex
justices as tending to promote breaches of the peace. One of these may
have been the occasion on which an obscure actor, Garlick by name, made
himself offensive to the more refined part of his audience.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> On the
following 7 November Henry died and on 7 December his players figured
in his funeral procession.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>They found a new patron in the Elector Palatine, then in England,
and on entering his service got a new patent, which bears date 11
January 1613 and closely follows in its terms that of 1606.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> The
house specified for them was again the Fortune, which they had no
doubt continuously occupied since its opening in 1600. The players
named were ‘Thomas Downton, William Bird, Edward Juby, Samuell Rowle,
Charles Massey, Humfrey Jeffs, Frank Grace, William Cartwright, Edward
Colbrand, William Parr, William Stratford, Richard Gunnell, John
Shanck, and Richard Price’. Possibly Price may be the Pryor of the 1610
list. Cartwright and Gunnell are new since that list, but Cartwright
had been in <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i> and <i>1 Tamar Cham</i> plots
of 1601 and 1602. These two must be supposed to have taken the places
of Thomas Towne and Antony Jeffes. Thomas Towne had enjoyed an annuity
of £12 out of Alleyn’s manor of Dulwich from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> 28 October 1608 to 15
January 1612, but on 5 November 1612 ‘widow Towne’ is mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
and further evidence of his death is supplied by a letter from Charles
Massey to Alleyn, not dated, but from internal evidence written not
very long after the prince’s death, to which reference is made. Massey
is in debt and wants £50. He offers two things as security. One is
‘that lyttell moete I have in the play hovsses’; from which it may
be inferred that, like Downton, he had obtained an interest in the
Fortune, although what the second house may have been can hardly be
conjectured. The other is his interest under ‘the composisions betwene
ovre compenye that if any one give over with consent of his fellowes,
he is to receve three score and ten poundes (Antony Jefes hath had
so much) if any on dye his widow or frendes whome he appoyntes it
tow reseve fyfte poundes (M<sup>r</sup>es Pavie and M<sup>r</sup>es Tovne hath had the
lyke)’. In order to be in a position to repay the loan at the end of
the year he undertakes to get Mr. Jube to reserve ‘my gallery mony
and my quarter of the hovse mony’ for the purpose, and should it
prove at the end of six months that this will be insufficient, he
will be prepared to surrender his whole share, with the exception of
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a week for household expenses.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> From this
letter it may also be gathered that Antony Jeffes had retired, and
apparently that Pavy, whose name is found in the plot of <i>2 Fortune’s
Tennis</i>, which I assign to 1602–3, had at some time become a sharer
in the company. One other player, originally in 1597 a hired man, had
evidently reached some prominence between that date and 1614. William
Fennor, in the course of a rhyming controversy with John Taylor, makes
the following boast of his histrionic talent:</p>

<p>As the Elector Palatine’s men the company played at Court during the
winter of 1613–14, twice before James and once before Charles. They
were amongst the companies which performed irregularly in the Lent
of 1615, and Humphrey Jeffes and Thomas Downton were summoned before
the Privy Council to account for their misdoing. One of the irregular
licences condemned by the Lord Chamberlain on 16 July 1616 was an
exemplification of the patent of 1613, taken out by Charles Marshall,
Humphrey Jeffes, and William Parr for provincial purposes.</p>


<h5>xx. THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN’S (LORD HUNSDON’S) AND KING’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Henry Carey, s. of William Carey and Mary, sister of Anne
Boleyn; <i>nat. c.</i> 1524; cr. 1st Lord Hunsdon, 13 Jan. 1559;
m. Anne, d. of Sir Thomas Morgan; Warden of East Marches and
Governor of Berwick, Aug. 1568; Lord Chamberlain, 4 July 1585;
lived at Hunsdon House, Herts., and Somerset House, London;
<i>ob.</i> 22 July 1596.</p>

<p>George Carey, s. of Henry, 1st Lord Hunsdon; <i>nat.</i> 1547;
Kt. 18 May 1570; m. Elizabeth, d. of Sir John Spencer of
Althorp; Captain-General of Isle of Wight, 1582; succ. as 2nd
Baron, 22 July 1596; Lord Chamberlain, 17 Mar. 1597; lived at
Carisbrooke Castle, Hunsdon House, Drayton, and Blackfriars;
<i>ob.</i> 9 Sept. 1603.</p>
</div>

<p>A company of Lord Hunsdon’s men was at Leicester in the last three
months of 1564, at Norwich and Maldon in 1564–5, at Plymouth before
Michaelmas in 1565, at Canterbury in the autumn of 1565, at Gloucester
and Maldon in 1565–6, at Bristol in July 1566, and at Canterbury in the
spring of 1567. Another makes its appearance at Ludlow on 13 July 1581,
and at Doncaster in 1582. In the winter Lord Hunsdon was apparently
deputy for the Earl of Sussex as Lord Chamberlain, and took occasion to
bring his men to Court, where they acted <i>Beauty and Housewifery</i>
on 27 December 1582. They did not again appear at Court, but when
plays were temporarily suppressed on 14 June 1584 the owner of the
Theatre, presumably James Burbadge, made a claim to be Lord Hunsdon’s
man. Meanwhile ‘my L. Hunsdouns and my Lords Morleis players being
bothe of one companye’ are recorded at Bristol in March 1583, and Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
Hunsdon’s alone at Norwich in 1582–3, Bath in June 1583, and Exeter
in July 1583. Hunsdon became Lord Chamberlain on 4 July 1585. Between
October and December of that year, a visit was paid to Leicester by
‘the Lord Chamberlens and the Lord Admiralls players’, and on 6 January
1586 ‘the servants of the lo: Admirall and the lo: Chamberlaine’ gave
a play at Court. These entries suggest an amalgamation of Hunsdon’s
men with those of Lord Admiral Howard, both of whom had perhaps been
weakened by the formation of the Queen’s men in 1583. But if so, it
was only a partial or temporary one, for while the Admiral’s men
established themselves in London, the Chamberlain’s are traceable in
the provinces, at Coventry in 1585–6, at Saffron Walden in 1587–8, and
at Maidstone in 1589–90.</p>

<p>An interval of four or five years renders improbable any continuity
between this company and the famous Lord Chamberlain’s company, which
first emerged on the resorting of the plague-stricken mimes in 1594,
passed under royal patronage in 1603, and prolonged an existence
illumined by the genius of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont and
Fletcher, Massinger and Shirley, until the closing of the theatres
in 1642. The first notice of the new organization is in June 1594,
when ‘my Lord Admeralle men and my Lorde Chamberlen men’ played from
the 3rd to the 13th of the month, either in combination or separately
on allotted days, for Henslowe at Newington Butts.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Some of
the plays given during this period can be traced to the subsequent
repertory of the Admiral’s men; others, which cannot, may be assigned
to the Chamberlain’s. They are <i>Hester and Ahasuerus</i>, <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, and <i>Taming of A Shrew</i>, which,
although so described, may of course have been really the <i>Taming
of The Shrew</i>, Shakespeare’s adaptation of the older play entered
in the Stationers’ Register on the previous 2 May. It is ingeniously,
and I think rightly, inferred from a line drawn in Henslowe’s account
after 13 June, that from that date all the performances recorded are by
the Admiral’s men, probably at the Rose, and that his relations with
the Chamberlain’s men had ceased. The company is found at Marlborough
about September, and on 8 October Lord Hunsdon wrote to the Lord Mayor,
asking permission for ‘my nowe companie’ to continue an occupation
of the Cross Keys,<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> on which it seems to have already entered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Henceforward the company was regularly established in London, took the
lead annually at Court, and except for brief periods of inhibition in
1596, 1597, and possibly 1601, does not appear to have travelled during
the remainder of Elizabeth’s reign. Whether Hunsdon’s men got the Cross
Keys for the winter or not, they probably had from the beginning the
use of the Theatre for the summer seasons, for Richard Burbage, the
son of the owner, was one of their leading members, and on 15 March
1595 appears as joint payee with William Kempe and William Shakespeare
for two plays given at Court on 26 and 28 December 1594. These plays
cannot be identified, but Shakespeare’s <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i> and
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> may well have been produced this winter.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
Most likely the date 28 December was entered in the payment warrant
by mistake for 27 December, for the Admiral’s men are also recorded
as playing at Court on 28 December, and on the same night ‘a company
of base and common fellows’, with whom one is bound to identify
the Chamberlain’s men, played ‘a Comedy of Errors’ as part of the
Christmas revels of the Prince of Purpoole at Gray’s Inn.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> There
seems to be some echo of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> in the Pyramus and
Thisbe interlude of <i>A Midsummer-Night’s Dream</i>, which may very
well have been given at Greenwich or Burghley House for the wedding
of William Stanley, Earl of Derby, and Elizabeth Vere, daughter of
the Earl of Oxford, on 26 January 1595. Another possible occasion
for the production, however, is the wedding of Elizabeth, daughter
of Sir George Carey and grand-daughter of Lord Hunsdon, to Thomas,
son of Henry Lord Berkeley on 19 February 1596. This took place at
Blackfriars, presumably in Sir George Carey’s house there.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>To 1595 or thereabouts I also assign Shakespeare’s <i>Two Gentlemen
of Verona</i> and <i>King John</i> and <i>Richard II</i>.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The
company played at Court on 26, 27, and 28 December 1595<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> and 6 January
and 22 February 1596. In the warrant for their fees, dated on 21
December 1596, and made payable to John Heminges and George Bryan, they
are described as ‘servauntes to the late Lord Chamberlayne and now
servauntes to the Lorde Hunsdon’. It is clear that, when the first Lord
Hunsdon died on 22 July 1596, the players had been retained by his son
and heir, Sir George Carey. The Lord Chamberlainship passed to Lord
Cobham; but he died on 5 March 1597, and on 17 March the post was given
to the second Lord Hunsdon. The company, then, was properly known as
Lord Hunsdon’s men from 22 July 1596 to 17 March 1597; before and after
that period it was the Lord Chamberlain’s men.</p>

<p>To 1596 I assign Shakespeare’s <i>Merchant of Venice</i>. Evidence of
the occupation of the Theatre about this time by the company is to be
found in Lodge’s allusion to a revival of <i>Hamlet</i> there, for
this play is not likely to have been in other hands.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> It is not
an unreasonable conjecture that James Burbadge destined to their use
the play-house in the Blackfriars, which he purchased in February, and
had converted for ‘publique’ use by November of this year. If so, he
and they were disappointed, for a petition of the inhabitants, amongst
the signatories to an alleged copy of which Lord Hunsdon himself is
somewhat oddly found, led to an intervention of the Privy Council,
who forbade plays to be given within the liberty.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> At this time
also the Corporation seem to have succeeded in finally and permanently
expelling the players from the City inns which had long been their
head-quarters, and Nashe connects this persecution with the loss of
‘their old Lord’, by whom he doubtless means Henry Lord Hunsdon. It
is possible that plays were inhibited altogether during the summer
of 1596, although no formal order to that effect is preserved, for
Hunsdon’s went to Faversham, and Nashe himself was disappointed of
‘an after harvest I expected by writing for the stage and for the
presse’.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>In the following winter the company played at Court on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> 26 and 27
December 1596 and on 1 and 6 January and 6 and 8 February 1597. Their
payees, for this and for the next two years, were Thomas Pope and John
Heminge. In 1597 began the printing of plays written by Shakespeare for
this company, with a ‘bad’ quarto of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, bearing
on its title-page the name of Lord Hunsdon’s men and ‘good’ quartos
of <i>Richard II</i> and <i>Richard III</i>, bearing that of the Lord
Chamberlain’s.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> From the text of <i>Richard II</i> was omitted the
deposition scene, which did not appear in print until after the death
of Elizabeth. The only Shakespearian productions that can be plausibly
ascribed to this year are those of the two parts of <i>Henry IV</i>.
The presentation of Sir John Oldcastle in the original versions of
these seems to have led to a protest, and the character was renamed
Sir John Falstaff. It is not improbable that the offence taken was by
Lord Chamberlain Cobham, whose ancestress, Joan Lady Cobham, Oldcastle
had married.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> It is impossible to say whether either this scandal
or any possible interpretation of disloyalty put upon <i>Richard
II</i> contributed to the inhibition of plays on 28 July, of which the
main exciting cause was certainly the performance of <i>The Isle of
Dogs</i> at the Swan on the Bankside.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> For the second time since
their formation in 1594 the company had to travel. They are traceable
at Rye in August, at Dover between 3 and 20 September, at Marlborough,
Faversham, and Bath during 1596–7, and at Bristol about 29 September.
This inhibition was removed early in October. There is some reason to
believe that, when the Chamberlain’s men resumed playing, it was not
at the Theatre, as to the renewal of the lease of which the Burbadges
were disputing with their ground landlord, but at the Curtain. Marston,
in one and the same passage of his <i>Scourge of Villainy</i>, entered
in the Stationers’ Register on 8 September 1598, alludes to the acting
of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and to ‘Curtaine plaudeties’, while almost
simultaneously Edward Guilpin in his <i>Skialetheia</i>, entered on
15 September, speaks of ‘the unfrequented Theater’. The transfer may,
however, not have taken place until 1598.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>The company played at Court on 26 December 1597 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> on 1 and 6
January and 26 February 1598. It is conceivable that one of these
plays may have been a revised version of <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>,
which was printed as ‘newly corrected and augmented’ and ‘as it
was presented before her Highnes this last Christmas’ in 1598. On
the other hand, it is also possible that this print may have been
intended to replace an earlier ‘bad’ quarto, not now preserved, and
if so, the reference to the representation may have been carried on
from the earlier title-page. In 1598 were also printed <i>1 Henry
IV</i>, and the anonymous <i>Mucedorus</i>, which may have already
belonged to the Chamberlain’s repertory, as it was certainly revised
for them about 1610. <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> was entered in the
Stationers’ Register on 22 July, but with a proviso that it must not
be printed ‘without lycence first had from the Right honorable the
lord chamberlen’. On 7 September 1598 was entered in the Stationers’
Register the <i>Palladis Tamia</i> of Francis Meres, with its list of
Shakespeare’s plays up to date, including the mysterious <i>Love’s
Labours Won</i>, which I incline to identify with the <i>Taming of the
Shrew</i>.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> The earliest play not mentioned by Meres is probably
<i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, which may belong to 1598 itself. Another
production of this year was Jonson’s <i>Every Man In his Humour</i>,
which was still a new play about 20 September, when an Almain in the
audience lost 300 crowns. Possibly John Aubrey has this period in mind
when he says that Jonson ‘acted and wrote, but both ill, at the Green
Curtaine, a kind of nursery or obscure play-house, somewhere in the
suburbes, I thinke towardes Shoreditch or Clarkenwell’.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Jonson,
however, was in prison soon after the production of the play for the
manslaughter of Gabriel Spencer on 22 September in Hoxton Fields, and
there is no other evidence that he ever acted with the Chamberlain’s
men. His own name is not in the list of the original ‘principall
Comoedians’ affixed to the text of <i>Every Man In his Humour</i> in
the folio of 1616. This is of great value, as being the earliest extant
list of the company. The ten names given are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will. Shakespeare.</li>
  <li>Aug. Philips.</li>
  <li>Hen. Condel.</li>
  <li>Will. Slye.</li>
  <li>Will. Kempe.</li>
  <li>Ric. Burbage.</li>
  <li>Joh. Flemings.</li>
  <li>Tho. Pope.</li>
  <li>Chr. Beeston.</li>
  <li>Joh. Duke.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<p>It must not, of course, be assumed, either that the list is in
itself quite complete, or that there had been no changes amongst the
Chamberlain’s men between 1594 and 1598; but as those named include
five out of the six payees for that period, they may perhaps be taken,
with the sixth payee, George Bryan, who does not reappear after
1596, and was by 1603 an ordinary groom of the Chamber of the royal
Household, as fairly representing the original constitution of the
company.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> And an inference to its origin at once becomes possible,
for of these eleven men five (Kempe, Pope, Heminges, Phillips, and
Bryan) formed, with Edward Alleyn, the company of Lord Strange’s men
to whom Privy Council letters of assistance were granted in 1593, and
at least six (Pope, Phillips, Bryan, Burbadge, Duke, and Sly) are
to be found in the cast of <i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i> as performed
by Strange’s or the Admiral’s or the two together about 1590–1. It
will be remembered that the Strange’s company of 1593, known as the
Earl of Derby’s after 25 September 1593, was apparently formed by a
combination of the earlier Strange’s and Admiral’s men somewhere near
the time of this performance, if not earlier, and that its composite
character never wholly disappeared, Alleyn in particular, who was its
leading member, retaining his personal status as an Admiral’s man.
It seems clear that in 1594 the combination broke up, that Alleyn
became the nucleus of a new Admiral’s company at the Rose, and that
the group with whom he had been travelling took fresh service with the
Lord Chamberlain. It is not, I think, quite accurate to treat this
transaction as a mere continuance of Lord Derby’s men under the style
of Lord Chamberlain’s, entailing no reconstruction other than a change
of patron following upon Lord Derby’s death on 16 April 1594. On the
one hand a Derby’s company continued in existence, and is traceable
under the sixth earl from 1594 to 1617. On the other hand, while
we do not know what business reconstruction there may have been, a
very fundamental change is involved in the replacement of Alleyn as
principal actor by Richard Burbadge, who is not at all likely to have
played with Strange’s men after the break between the Admiral’s and
his father at the Theatre in 1591. Except for Alleyn, all the more
important members of the company, as it existed in 1593, seem to have
been included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> in the transfer to Lord Hunsdon. It is, however, little
more than conjecture that finds Henry Condell and Christopher Beeston
in the ‘Harry’ and ‘Kitt’, or Alexander Cooke, Nicholas Tooley, and
Robert Gough, who were numbered amongst the King’s men at a later
date, in the ‘Saunder’, ‘Nick’, and ‘R. Go.’ of the <i>2 Seven Deadly
Sins</i> plot. Alleyn’s correspondence of 1593 adds Richard Cowley to
the list of Lord Strange’s men, and, as we shall find him acting as a
payee for the Chamberlain’s men in 1601, he may have been one of them
from the beginning. In any case he had joined them by 1598, as the
stage-directions of <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> show that he played
Verges to Kempe’s Dogberry.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>There is, of course, one conspicuous Chamberlain’s man who is not
discoverable either in the Privy Council letter of 1593 or in the <i>2
Seven Deadly Sins</i> of 1590–1. Even the audacity of Mr. Fleay has not
attempted to identify the ‘Will’ of the plot with Will Shakespeare.
Some relations, if only as author, Shakespeare must have had with Lord
Strange’s men, when they produced <i>1 Henry VI</i> on 3 March 1592,
and Greene’s satire of him as a ‘Shake-scene’ in the same year must
indicate that he was an actor as well as an author.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> He may have
stood aside altogether during the period of the provincial tours,
and devoted himself to poetry, and perhaps, although this is very
conjectural, to travel abroad. Or he may, as I have already suggested,
have joined Lord Pembroke’s men (q.v.), whom I suspect to have been
an offshoot for provincial purposes of the Strange’s combination, and
have passed from them to Lord Sussex’s, ultimately rejoining his old
fellows in 1594. The possibility of identifying certain minor members
of the Chamberlain’s company is also affected by this somewhat obscure
problem of Pembroke’s men. The most obvious of these is John Sincler or
Sincklo, who was in the cast of <i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i> as played
by the Admiral’s or Strange’s about 1590–1, and must have ultimately
joined the Chamberlain’s, as his name occurs in a stage-direction to
Q<sub>1</sub> of <i>2 Henry IV</i> (1600), and in the induction to <i>The
Malcontent</i> (1604). It also occurs in stage-directions to <i>3
Henry VI</i> and the <i>Taming of The Shrew</i> in the Folio of
1623.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> These both happen to be plays which passed through the
hands of Pembroke’s, and the inference may be that Sincler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> had also
passed through this company. But this is far from being conclusive. It
is the revised and not the unrevised texts that yield the name, and
although I think it likely, on stylistic grounds, that the revision of
<i>3 Henry VI</i> was done for Pembroke’s (q.v.), it is probable from
the reference in <i>Henry V</i>, epil. 12, to the loss of France and
the civil wars, ‘which oft our stage hath shown’, that the play was
revived by the Chamberlain’s, and it may have been in such a revival
that Sincler took part. As to the <i>Shrew</i>, it is impossible to say
whether Shakespeare’s work upon it was before or after its transfer
to the Chamberlain’s. In any case the Chamberlain’s were playing it
in some form on 13 June 1594, so that here again the appearance of
Sincler’s name cannot ear-mark him as Pembroke’s. We can now go a
step farther. The stage-directions to <i>3 Henry VI</i> contain not
only Sincler’s name, but those of a certain ‘Gabriel’ and a certain
‘Humfrey’, not common Elizabethan names even separately, and certainly
suggesting, when found in combination, the Gabriel Spencer and Humphrey
Jeffes, who were fellows of the Admiral’s in 1597. Now Spencer, and
very likely also Jeffes, had come from Pembroke’s, the short-lived
Pembroke’s of 1597 at the Swan. Had they been Pembroke’s men ever
since 1593? If so, it would be difficult to resist the conclusion
that the performance which brought their names into the text of <i>3
Henry VI</i>, and with theirs John Sincler’s, was one by Pembroke’s
about that date. The obstacle is that there is no known evidence,
in provincial records or elsewhere, for any continuous existence
of Pembroke’s between 1593 and 1597. Pending the discovery of any
such evidence, it seems better to assume that Sincler, Spencer, and
Jeffes were all Chamberlain’s men before 1597, and that it was from
a combination of discontented elements in that company and in the
Admiral’s that the Pembroke’s of the Swan arose. If so, the rest of
the Pembroke’s men not traceable as coming from the Admiral’s, namely
Robert Shaw, William Bird <i>alias</i> Borne, and probably Anthony
Jeffes, may also have come from the Chamberlain’s; and such an origin
might explain the suit with Thomas Pope in which Bird was entangled
in 1598.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Two other minor actors in the company about 1597 were
probably Harvey and Rossill, whose names appear to have got into the
text of <i>1 Henry IV</i> in place of those of Bardolph and Peto, whom
they represented.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> The list of actors in Shakespeare’s plays given
by the editors of the First Folio includes Samuel Crosse, of whom
nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> more is known except that he was of an early generation. As
the list in the Folio appears to be limited to Chamberlain’s and King’s
men, excluding for example Alleyn, who certainly acted in Shakespearian
plays, e.g. <i>1 Henry VI</i>, it may be that Crosse was for a short
time a member of the company soon after 1594.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to carry the analysis of origins any further with
profit, or to assume that the groups which segregated themselves from
the Strange-Admiral’s combination in 1594 bore any close correspondence
to the respective contributions of Strange’s and the Admiral’s to that
combination in 1589 or 1590. The only name that can be connected with
Strange’s men before 1588 is John Symons and neither he nor George
Attewell, their payee in 1591, became a Chamberlain’s man. Hypotheses
have been framed, mainly in the hope of affiliating Shakespeare to
Lord Leicester’s men, who are supposed to have carried him away from
Stratford-on-Avon when they visited it in 1586–7, and ultimately
to have become Lord Strange’s men.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> So far as Shakespeare is
concerned, the first record of him on the boards is in 1592, and
the interval since his hegira from Stratford may have been quite
otherwise spent. The proof of continuity between Leicester’s men and
Strange’s altogether fails, since the latter made their appearance a
decade before the former came to an end. The only member of the Lord
Chamberlain’s company of 1594 who can be traced to Leicester’s service
was Kempe, and he had left Leicester’s men by the summer of 1586 and
was in Denmark. With him were Bryan and Pope, who afterwards spent a
year in Germany, and may have joined either Strange’s or the Admiral’s
on their return. The only other Chamberlain’s man, who can be assigned
to an earlier company than Strange’s, is Heminges, who was probably at
some time a Queen’s man.</p>

<p>The Chamberlain’s men evidently started business in 1594 with something
of a repertory derived by inheritance or purchase from antecedent
companies. Our knowledge of this is mainly confined to plays with
which Shakespeare was concerned as author or reviser. They certainly
did not get all the plays produced by Strange’s men at the Rose
during 1592 and 1593. Some of these were Henslowe’s property; others
passed with Alleyn to the Admiral’s men. But they got <i>The Jealous
Comedy</i>, if I am right in identifying this with <i>The Comedy of
Errors</i>. They probably got <i>1 Henry VI</i>, for although the
appearance of a Shakespearian play in the 1623<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> Folio is not perhaps,
in view of the composition of the 1647 ‘Beaumont and Fletcher’ Folio,
absolute proof that the King’s men possessed the copy, their stage
had often shown both the loss of France and the bleeding of England
before <i>Henry V</i> was produced in 1599.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> And they got <i>Titus
and Vespasian</i>, as revised, after passing through the hands of
Pembroke’s men, for production by Sussex’s under the title of <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>. Three other of Pembroke’s men’s plays came to them,
<i>The Taming of A Shrew</i> and <i>2 and 3 Henry VI</i>, and probably
<i>Hamlet</i> belongs to the same group. It is of course only a guess
of mine that these also went with Shakespeare to Sussex’s men and
came thence with him. <i>Titus Andronicus</i> and <i>A Shrew</i>,
indeed, became available in print during 1594, but not <i>Hamlet</i>,
and not <i>Henry VI</i>, except in the obsolete version called <i>The
Contention of York and Lancaster</i>. I think Shakespeare must also
have brought <i>Richard III</i> and possibly an early version of
<i>Henry VIII</i>, and that one or other of these had already been
played by Sussex’s as <i>Buckingham</i>. Of the <i>provenance</i> of
<i>Hester and Ahasuerus</i> nothing can be said. It is not necessary to
suppose that the Chamberlain’s acquired any plays from the stock of the
Queen’s men. It is true that Shakespeare subsequently made some use of
<i>The Troublesome Reign of King John</i>, <i>The Famous Victories of
Henry V</i>, and <i>King Leire</i>, but these were all in print before
he needed them.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> <i>Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany</i>, published in
1654 as a play the King’s men at the Blackfriars is believed by some
to be an early play, possibly by Peele, and if so, may belong to the
repertory of 1594.</p>

<p>I now return to the chronicle of the Chamberlain’s men from 1598
onwards. The restriction of the London companies by the action of
the Privy Council to two had left them in direct rivalry with the
Admiral’s at the Rose. Disputes broke out. Henslowe made a loan to
William Bird of the Admiral’s on 30 August 1598 to follow a ‘sewt
agenste Thomas Poope’, and another to Thomas Downton on 30 January
1599, ‘to descarge Thomas Dickers [Dekker] from the areaste of my lord
chamberlens men’.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> The company played at Court on 26 December 1598
and 1 January and 20 February 1599. During this winter they undertook
the enterprise of finding a new head-quarters on the Bankside. The
disputes between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> landlord and tenants as to the lease of the Theatre
had reached a crisis, and in December or January the Burbadges removed
the timber of the house across the Thames, to serve as material for
the construction of the Globe. The lease of the new site was signed
on 21 February 1599. Under it one moiety of the interest was retained
by Richard Burbadge and his brother Cuthbert, who was not himself an
actor; the other was assigned to Shakespeare, Pope, Phillips, Heminges,
and Kempe.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Shortly afterwards Kempe made over his share to the
other four. Presumably he now quitted the company, having first, as a
stage-direction shows, played Peter in the revised version of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i> printed in 1599. His place was probably taken by Robert
Armin, formerly of Lord Chandos’s men, who describes himself in two
successive issues of his <i>Fool upon Fool</i> (1600 and 1605), first
as ‘clonnico del Curtanio’, and then as ‘clonnico del Mondo’, and
who had therefore probably joined the Chamberlain’s men before their
actual transfer to the Globe. As the Theatre had to be built, this is
not likely to have taken place until the autumn of 1599, and it must
therefore remain doubtful which house was the ‘wooden O’ of <i>Henry
V</i>, produced during the absence of Essex in Ireland between 27
March and 28 September 1599. It was, however, certainly at the Globe
that Thomas Platter saw <i>Julius Caesar</i> on 21 September.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
‘This fair-filled Globe’, too, is named in the epilogue to Jonson’s
<i>Every Man Out of his Humour</i>, which is ascribed in the Folio
of 1606 to 1599, although if this be correct, an apparent allusion
to Kempe’s journey to Norwich in the spring of 1600 must, on the
assumption that it is a real allusion, be an interpolation. The
‘principall Comoedians’ in this play were Burbadge, Heminges, Phillips,
Condell, Sly, and Pope. Four of the 1598 names are missing. Shakespeare
evidently stood aside. Kempe had gone. Beeston and Duke may have gone
also, although it is only a conjecture of Mr. Fleay’s that they and
Kempe now seceded to Pembroke’s men at the Rose, and they are not
definitely heard of again until they are found with Worcester’s men
in August 1602.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> Mr. Fleay thinks that another Worcester’s man,
Robert Pallant, had accompanied them; but, although Pallant was with
Strange’s or the Admiral’s about 1590, there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> evidence that he
was ever a Chamberlain’s man. Conceivably he may have joined the King’s
men about 1619, but that is another matter.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> About November 1599
was published <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i>, which belonged to the
company.</p>

<p>The Court plays called for from the Chamberlain’s men during the
following winter were on 26 December 1599 and on 6 January and 3
February 1600. Heminges was sole payee, and occupied the same position
in every subsequent year, up to and beyond 1616, except in 1600–1, when
Richard Cowley was associated with him, and for a special payment made
to Burbadge in 1604. On 6 March 1600 the company had an opportunity
of rendering direct service to their patron Lord Hunsdon, by playing
<i>Henry IV</i>, still oddly called <i>Sir John Oldcastle</i>, after
a dinner which he gave to the Flemish ambassador, Ludovic Verreyken,
presumably at his house in the Blackfriars.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> To 1600 I assign
Shakespeare’s <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, not improbably prepared
for performance, with the aid of the boys of Windsor Chapel, at the
Garter Feast on 23 April, and also <i>As You Like It</i>. This was a
year of some activity among the publishers and, as in 1598, the company
had to take steps to protect their interests. In May John Roberts was
prevented from printing their moral of <i>Cloth Breeches and Velvet
Hose</i>, until he could bring proper authority, and in August a note
was made in the Stationers’ Register to stay the printing of <i>As You
Like It</i>, <i>Henry V</i>, and <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
The last two of these, but not the first, were in fact printed during
the year, and so were <i>A Midsummer-Night’s Dream</i>, <i>The Merchant
of Venice</i>, <i>2 Henry IV</i>, <i>Every Man Out of his Humour</i>,
and <i>An Alarum for London</i>, all plays belonging to the company.</p>

<p>The Chamberlain’s men played at Court on 26 December 1600 and on 6
January and 24 February 1601. Shortly before this last performance,
they had been involved in one of the tragedies of history. This was
the abortive <i>coup d’état</i> of 8 February 1601 in which the Earl
of Essex, smarting under the disgrace which his failure in Ireland
had brought upon him, attempted to secure his position and get rid of
Sir Walter Raleigh and other enemies by taking forcible possession
of the person of Elizabeth and the palace of Whitehall. Some of his
followers seem to have conceived the idea of predisposing the mind
of the populace to their cause by a dramatic representation of the
dangers of evil counsellors and the possible remedy of a deposition, as
illustrated in the case of Elizabeth’s predecessor Richard II, in whom
for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> obscure reason the political thought of the time was fond of
finding an analogue to the Queen. Saturday, 7 February, the day before
the outbreak, was chosen for the performance, and the players applied
to were the Chamberlain’s. A deposition by Augustine Phillips, taken
before Chief Justice Popham and Justice Fenner during the subsequent
inquiries, records the transaction.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The Examination of Augustine Phillips, servant unto the L.
Chamberlain and one of his players, taken the xviij<sup>th</sup> of
February, 1600, upon his oath.</p>

<p>‘He saith that on Friday last was sennight or Thursday Sir
Charles Percy Sir Josceline Percy and the Lord Mounteagle with
some three more spoke to some of the players in the presence
of this Examinate to have the play of the deposing and killing
of King Richard the Second to be played the Saturday next,
promising to get them xl<i>s.</i> more than their ordinary to
play it. Where this Examinate and his fellows were determined to
have played some other play, holding that play of King Richard
to be so old and so long out of use that they should have small
or no company at it. But at their request this Examinate and
his fellows were content to play it the Saturday and had their
xl<sup><i>s.</i></sup> more than their ordinary for it, and so played it
accordingly.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The fact that Phillips speaks of the play as old and long out of
use, which becomes in the narrative of Camden ‘exoleta tragoedia’,
hardly justifies the suggestion that it was something earlier than
Shakespeare’s <i>Richard II</i>. This, if produced in 1596, may well
have been off the boards by 1601.</p>

<p>A good deal of misunderstanding has gathered round the connexion of
the Chamberlain’s men with this affair. Mr. Fleay is responsible for
the theory that they fell into disgrace, had to travel, and were
excluded from the Court festivities of the following Christmas.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> As
a matter of fact they played four times during that winter. This Mr.
Fleay did not know, as he only had before him Cunningham’s incomplete
extracts from the accounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber. But he
ought to have noticed that their last performance for 1600–1 was
itself some days later than the examination of Augustine Phillips.
Nor is any evidence that the company travelled in 1601 forthcoming
from the provincial archives. Mr. Fleay’s identification of them with
Laurence Fletcher’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> Scottish company of that year merely rests upon
the presence of Fletcher’s name in the patent of 1603, and this will
not bear the strain of the argument.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Thus remains, however, the
possibly autobiographical passage in <i>Hamlet</i>, ii. 2. 346, which
assigns an ‘inhibition by the means of the late innovation’ as a cause
of the travelling of players to Elsinore. The date of <i>Hamlet</i>
may well be 1601, since the same passage refers to the theatrical
competition set up by the establishment of boy companies at St. Paul’s
in 1599 and at the Chapel Royal in 1600. But it must be borne in mind
that this competition is the only reason given for the travelling in
the 1603 edition of the play. In the 1604 edition the only reason
is the inhibition, while in the text of the 1623 Folio both reasons
stand somewhat inconsistently side by side.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> No doubt the text
of 1603 is an imperfect piratical reprint. On the other hand that of
1604 almost certainly represents a revised version of the play, and
the ‘inhibition’ cited, if it had an historical existence at all,
may be that of 1603, during which certainly the company travelled. I
suppose that ‘innovation’ might mean the accession of a new sovereign,
although it does not seem a very obvious term. But then it does not
seem a very obvious term for a seditious rising either.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> On the
whole, there is no reason to suppose that any serious blame was
attached to the Chamberlain’s men for lending themselves to Sir Gilly
Meyrick’s intrigue. It is certainly absurd to suggest, as has been
suggested, that the ‘adorned creature’, whose ingratitude instigated
the comparison between Elizabeth and Richard, was not Essex but
Shakespeare.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> At the same time the company may, of course, have
been told to leave London for a few weeks. At some time, as the 1603
title-page tells us, they took <i>Hamlet</i> both to Oxford and to
Cambridge, and it is at least tempting to find a reminiscence of the
Cambridge visit in the scene from <i>2 Return from Parnassus</i> cited
below. It is possible that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> Phillips and his fellows, and even their
relation to the Essex crisis itself, may be glanced at in the satirical
picture of the Roman actors in Jonson’s <i>Poetaster</i>, produced by
the Chapel boys in the course of 1601.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Certainly the play betrays
its author’s knowledge of a counter-attack which the Chamberlain’s men
were already preparing for him in Dekker’s <i>Satiromastix</i>. This
play, in which Dekker may have had some help from Marston, was entered
in the Stationers’ Register on 11 November 1601, and had probably been
on the stage not long before. It is noteworthy that it was produced by
the Paul’s boys, as well as by the Chamberlain’s men. It was actually
published in 1602. Another play which may reasonably be assigned to
1601 is <i>Twelfth Night</i>.</p>

<p>In the following winter the company played at Court on 26 and 27
December 1601 and on 1 January and 14 February 1602. They also gave
<i>Twelfth Night</i> at the Middle Temple feast on 2 February;<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
and I have very little doubt that it was they who furnished the
play at which Elizabeth and her maids of honour were present in the
Blackfriars after dining with Lord Hunsdon on 31 December.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> The
alleged production of <i>Othello</i> before the Queen when Sir Thomas
Egerton entertained her at Harefield from 31 July to 2 August 1602
rests on a forgery by Collier.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> It is possible that, as Professor
Wallace conjectures, the play was on the capture of Stuhl-Weissenburg,
seen by the Duke of Stettin on 13 September 1602, may have been a
Globe production.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> <i>Sir Thomas Cromwell</i>, a play of unknown
authorship belonging to the company, was published in the course of
1602, with an ascription on the title-page to W. S., and to this year
I assign Shakespeare’s <i>All’s Well that Ends Well</i> and <i>Troilus
and Cressida</i>. If so, the portrait of Ajax in the latter play cannot
very well have been the ‘purge’ administered by Shakespeare to Jonson,
to which reference is made in <i>2 Return from Parnassus</i>. This is
a Cambridge Christmas piece, probably of 1601–2, and in it Burbadge
and Kempe are introduced as in search of scholars to write for them.
Perhaps the Cambridge author did not know that Kempe had ceased to be
the ‘fellow’ of Burbadge and Shakespeare in 1599, and was at the time
playing with Worcester’s men at the Rose. It is, however, just possible
that after returning from his continental tour and before throwing in
his lot with Worcester’s, he may have rejoined the Chamberlain’s for a
while, and may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> have accompanied them to Cambridge, if they did travel
in 1601.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>The last performances of the company before Elizabeth took place on 26
December 1602 and 2 February 1603, and on the following 24 March the
Queen died. Playing immediately ceased in London. Strictly speaking,
the Chamberlain’s men must have again become Lord Hunsdon’s men for
a month or so, for the Household appointments naturally lapsed with
the death of the sovereign, and Hunsdon, being in failing health, was
relieved of his duties on 6 April. On 9 September he died.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> The
company, however, had already passed under royal patronage.</p>

<p>A contemporary panegyrist records the graciousness of James in
‘taking to him the late Lord Chamberlaines servants, now the Kings
acters’.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> The appointment was by letters patent dated 19 May 1603,
of which the text follows.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">Of the nine players named, eight are recognizable as the principal
members of the Lord Chamberlain’s company as it stood at the end of
Elizabeth’s reign. Only Thomas Pope is not included. He was near his
end. He made his will on 22 July 1603, and it was proved on 13 February
1604. In it he names none of his fellows, unless Robert Gough, who has
a legacy, was already of the company; his interest in the house of
the Globe passed to legatees and was thus alienated from the company.
Laurence Fletcher, on the other hand, whose name heads the list in
the patent, is not discernible as a Chamberlain’s man. His inclusion
becomes readily intelligible, when it is recalled that he had headed
English actors on tour in Scotland, and had already been marked by the
personal favour of James.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> Whether he ever joined the company in
the full sense, that is to say, the association of actors as distinct
from the body of royal servants, seems to me very doubtful. His name is
not in the <i>Sejanus</i> list, or in the Folio list of Shakespearian
players, and that he was described as a ‘fellow’ by Phillips in 1605
hardly takes the matter further. He may have held a relation to the
King’s men analogous to that of Martin Slater to Queen Anne’s men.
After 1605 nothing is heard of him.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>The terms of the patent imply that it was issued during a suspension
of playing through plague. Probably this had followed hard upon the
suspension at Elizabeth’s death. The company travelled, being found at
Bath, Coventry, and Shrewsbury in the course of 1602–3. A misplaced
Ipswich entry of 30 May 1602 may belong to 1603. The visits to Oxford
and Cambridge referred to on the title-page of the 1603 edition of
<i>Hamlet</i> must also have taken place in this year, if they did
not take place in 1601. On 2 December 1603 the company were summoned
from Mortlake to perform before the King at Lord Pembroke’s house of
Wilton.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>During the winter of 1603–4 the company gave eight more plays at
Court, a larger number than Elizabeth had ever called for. They took
place on 26, 27, 28, and 30 December 1603 and on 1 January and 2 and
19 February 1604. On New Year’s Day there were two performances, one
before James, the other before Prince Henry. The plague had not yet
subsided by 8 February, and James gave his men £30 as a ‘free gifte’
for their ‘mayntenaunce and releife’ till it should ‘please God to
settle the cittie in a more perfecte health’. One of the plays of this
winter was <i>The Fair Maid of Bristow</i>. Another, produced before
the end of 1603, was probably Ben Jonson’s <i>Sejanus</i>. For alleged
popery and treason in this play Jonson was haled before the Privy
Council by the Earl of Northampton, but there is nothing to show that
the players were implicated. The principal actors in <i>Sejanus</i>
were Burbadge, Shakespeare, Phillips, Heminges, Sly, Condell, John
Lowin, and Alexander Cooke. This is Shakespeare’s last appearance in
the cast of any play. He may have ceased to act, while remaining a
member of the company and its poet. The names of Lowin and Cooke are
new. Lowin had been with Worcester’s men in 1602–3. Cooke had probably
begun his connexion with the company as an apprentice to Heminges.
The identification of him with the ‘Sander’ of Strange’s men in 1590
is more than hazardous. The Induction to Marston’s <i>Malcontent</i>,
published in 1604, records the names of Burbadge, who played Malevole,
Condell, Sly, Lowin, Sincler, and a Tire-man. Sincler was probably
still only a hired man. Nothing further is heard of him. This
Induction seems to have been written by John Webster to introduce the
presentation by the King’s men of <i>The Malcontent</i>, which was
really a Chapel play. The transaction is thus explained:<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sly.</i> I wonder you would play it, another company having
interest in it?</p>

<p><i>Condell.</i> Why not Malevole in folio with us, as Jeronimo
in decimo-sexto with them? They taught us a name for our play;
we call it <i>One for Another</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The play of <i>Jeronimo</i>, which the Chapel are here
accused of taking, cannot be <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, which was an
Admiral’s play, and is not very likely to have been the ‘comedy of
Jeronimo’ which Strange’s men had in 1592, and which was evidently
related to <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> and may be expected to have
remained with it. It might be the extant <i>First Part of Jeronimo</i>,
written perhaps for the Chamberlain’s men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> about 1601–2, when Jonson
was revising <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> for the Admiral’s. A reference
in T. M.’s <i>Black Book</i> shows that <i>The Merry Devil of
Edmonton</i>, which belonged to the company, was already on the stage
by 1604.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>The coronation procession of James, deferred on account of the plague,
went through London on 15 March 1604, and the Great Wardrobe furnished
each of the King’s players with four and a half yards of red cloth. The
same nine men are specified in the warrant as in the patent of 1603,
and their names stand next those of various officers of the Chamber.
They did not, however, actually walk in the procession.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> From 9 to
27 August 1604, they were called upon in their official capacity as
Grooms of the Chamber to form part of the retinue assigned to attend
at Somerset House upon Juan Fernandez de Velasco, Duke of Frias and
Constable of Castile, who was in England as Ambassador Extraordinary
for the negotiation of a peace with Spain. The descriptions of his
visit, which have been preserved, do not show that any plays were given
before him.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>The company were at Oxford between 7 May and 16 June 1604. About
18 December they had got into trouble through the production of a
tragedy on <i>Gowry</i>, always a delicate subject with James.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>
But this did not interfere with a long series of no less than eleven
performances which they gave at Court between 1 November 1604 and
12 February 1605, and of which the Revels Accounts fortunately
preserve the names.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> The series included one play, <i>The Spanish
Maze</i>, of which nothing is known; two by Ben Jonson, <i>Every Man
In his Humour</i> and <i>Every Man Out of his Humour</i>; and seven
by Shakespeare, <i>Othello</i>, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>,
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, <i>Henry
V</i>, <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, and <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>,
which was given twice. <i>Othello</i> and <i>Measure for Measure</i>
had probably been produced for the first time during 1604, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> the
rest of the list suggests that opportunity was being taken to revive
a number of Elizabethan plays unknown to the new sovereigns. This
is borne out by the terms of a letter from Sir Walter Cope to Lord
Southampton with regard to the performance of <i>Love’s Labour ’s
Lost</i>.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>Between 4 May 1605, when he made his will, and 13 May, when it was
proved, died Augustine Phillips. Unlike Pope, he was full of kindly
remembrances towards the King’s men. He appointed Heminges, Burbadge,
and Sly overseers of the will. He left legacies to his ‘fellows’
Shakespeare, Condell, Fletcher, Armin, Cowley, Cooke, and Nicholas
Tooley; to the hired men of the company; to his ‘servant’ Christopher
Beeston; to his apprentice James Sands, and to his late apprentice
Samuel Gilburne. We have here practically a full list of the company.
The name of Nicholas Tooley is new, unless indeed he was the ‘Nick’ of
Strange’s men in 1592. He speaks of Richard Burbadge in his will as his
‘master’ and may have been his apprentice. The use of the term ‘fellow’
suggests that Tooley and Cooke were now sharers in the company. On
the other hand Lowin, who is not named among the ‘fellows’, may still
have been only a hired man. Beeston’s legacy is doubtless in memory
of former service as hired man or apprentice; he was in 1605 and for
long after with the Queen’s men. Samuel Gilburne is recorded as a
Shakespearian actor in the 1623 Folio, but practically nothing is known
of him or of James Sands. The exact legal disposal of the interest held
by Phillips in the Globe subsequently became matter of controversy, but
in effect it remained from 1605 to 1613 with his widow and her second
husband, and was thus alienated from the company.</p>

<p>On some date before Michaelmas in 1605 the King’s men visited
Barnstaple, and on 9 October they were at Oxford. This year saw the
publication of <i>The Fair Maid of Bristow</i> and of <i>The London
Prodigal</i>, which was assigned on its title-page to Shakespeare. To
it I also assign Shakespeare’s <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>King Lear</i>.</p>

<p>Ten Court plays were given in the winter of 1605–6, but the dates are
not recorded. Three more were given in the summer of 1606 during the
visit of the King of Denmark to James, which lasted from 7 July to 11
August, and then the company seem to have gone on tour. They were at
Oxford between 28 and 31 July, at Leicester in August, at Dover between
6 and 24 September, at Saffron Walden and Maidstone during 1605–6, and
at Marlborough in 1606. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> this year I assign Shakespeare’s <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i> and <i>Coriolanus</i>, and to the earlier part of
it Ben Jonson’s <i>Volpone</i>, in which the principal actors were
Burbadge, Condell, Sly, Heminges, Lowin, and Cooke.</p>

<p>Nine Court plays were given during the winter of 1606–7, on 26 and 29
December 1606, and on 4, 6, and 8 January and 2, 5, 15, and 27 February
1607. The entry in the Stationers’ Register for <i>King Lear</i> and
the title-page of Barnes’ <i>The Devil’s Charter</i>, both dated in
1607, show these to have been the plays selected for 26 December and 2
February respectively. In the same year were also published Tourneur’s
<i>The Revenger’s Tragedy</i> and Wilkins’ <i>The Miseries of Enforced
Marriage</i>, and to it I assign the production of <i>Timon of
Athens</i>. On 16 July 1607 Heminges lent his boy John Rice to appear
as an angel of gladness with a taper of frankincense, and deliver an
eighteen-verse speech by Ben Jonson as part of the entertainment of
James by the Merchant Taylors at their hall.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> During the summer the
company travelled to Barnstaple, to Dunwich, to Oxford, where they were
on 7 September, and possibly to Cambridge. <i>Volpone</i> had probably
been given in both Universities before its publication about February
1607 or 1608.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1607–8 the company gave thirteen Court plays, on
26, 27, and 28 December 1606, and on 2, 6, 7, 9, 17, and 26 January,
and 2 and 7 February 1607. On each of the nights of 6 and 17 January
there were two plays. In 1608 was published <i>A Yorkshire Tragedy</i>,
with Shakespeare’s name on the title-page, and to it I assign the
production of <i>Pericles</i>, in which Shakespeare probably had
Wilkins for a collaborator. About May the company had to find their
share of the heavy fine necessary to buy off the inhibition due to
the performance of Chapman’s <i>Duke of Byron</i> by the Queen’s
Revels.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> The year was in many ways an eventful one for the King’s
men. They had, I suspect, to face a growing detachment of Shakespeare
from London and the theatre; and the loss was perhaps partly supplied
by the establishment of relations with Beaumont and Fletcher, whose
earliest play for the company, <i>Philaster</i>, may be of any date
from 1608 to 1610. About 16 August died William Sly, leaving his
interest in the Globe to his son Robert and legacies to Cuthbert
Burbadge and James Sands. Both he and Henry Condell had been admitted
to an interest at some date subsequent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> November 1606, the moiety
of the lease not retained by the Burbadges having been redistributed
into sixths to allow of this. The deserts of Pope, Phillips, and Sly
are all commemorated in the <i>Apology</i> of Thomas Heywood, which,
though not published until 1612, was probably written in 1608.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
Sly’s death complicated an important transaction in which the King’s
men were engaged. This was the acquisition of the Blackfriars, of which
the freehold already belonged to the Burbadges, but which had been
leased since 1600 to Henry Evans and occupied by the Children of the
Revels. About July 1608 Evans was prepared to surrender his lease, and
the Burbadges decided to take the opportunity of providing the King’s
men with a second house on the north side of the Thames, suitable
for a winter head-quarters. As in the case of the Globe, they shared
their interest as housekeepers with some of the leading members of the
company. New leases were executed on 9 August 1608, by which the house
was divided between a syndicate of seven, of whom five were Richard
Burbadge, Shakespeare, Heminges, Condell, and Sly, while the other two,
Cuthbert Burbadge and Thomas Evans, were not King’s men. When Sly’s
death intervened, his executrix surrendered his interest and the number
of the syndicate was reduced to six. Probably, however, the King’s men
did not enter upon the actual occupation of the Blackfriars until the
autumn of the following year.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> In fact the plague kept the London
theatres closed from July 1608 to December 1609. The King’s men were
at Coventry on 29 October 1608 and at Marlborough in the course of
1607–8. The plague did not prevent them from appearing at Court during
the winter of 1608–9, and they gave twelve plays on unspecified dates.
But their difficulties are testified to by a special reward ‘for their
private practise in the time of infeccion’, which had rendered their
Christmas service possible.</p>

<p>The plague led to an early provincial tour. The company were at Ipswich
on 9 May, at Hythe on 16 May, and at New Romney on 17 May 1609. Their
winter season was again interfered with, and a further grant was
made in respect of six weeks of private practice. Amongst the plays
so practised may, I think, have been <i>Cymbeline</i>. They gave
thirteen plays at Court on unspecified dates during the holidays of
1609–10.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> One of these may have been <i>Mucedorus</i>, the edition
of which with the imprint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> 1610 represents a revised version performed
at Court on the previous Shrove Sunday. This might be either 18
February 1610 or 3 February 1611. The epilogue contains an apology for
some recent indiscretion of the company in a play of which no more is
known, but which might conceivably be Daborne’s <i>A Christian Turned
Turk</i>, since this certainly brought its players into some disgrace.
By April the company were at the Globe, playing <i>Macbeth</i> on 20
April, <i>Cymbeline</i> probably shortly before, and <i>Othello</i>
on 30 April.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> To this year I assign <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>
and Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>The Maid’s Tragedy</i>. It also saw
the production of Jonson’s <i>Alchemist</i>, with a cast including
Burbadge, Lowin, Condell, Cooke, Armin, Heminges, William Ostler, John
Underwood, Tooley, and William Ecclestone. This is the last mention of
Armin in connexion with the King’s men, but it is sufficient to show
that the production of his <i>Two Maids of Moreclack</i> by the King’s
Revels about 1608 did not involve any breach with his old company. Of
Ecclestone’s origin nothing is known.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Ostler and Underwood came
from the Queen’s Revels, probably when the Blackfriars was taken over
in 1609. In fact an account of the transaction given by the Burbadges
in 1635 suggests that the desire to acquire these boys was its
fundamental motive. They say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In processe of time, the boyes growing up to bee men, which
were Underwood, Field, Ostler, and were taken to strengthen the
King’s service; and the more to strengthen the service, the
boyes dayly wearing out, it was considered that house would bee
as fitt for ourselves, and soe purchased the lease remaining
from Evans with our money, and placed men players, which were
Heminges, Condall, Shakspeare, &amp;c.’</p>
</div>

<p>This narrative seems, however, to have antedated matters as regards
Field. Or, if he did come to the King’s men in 1609, he almost
immediately returned to the Queen’s Revels at Whitefriars, joining the
King’s again about 1616.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>About 8 May 1610 some superfluous apparel of the company was sold
by Heminges on their behalf to the Duke of York’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> men (q.v.). On
31 May Burbadge and Rice were employed by the City to make speeches
on fish-back at the civic pageant of welcome to Prince Henry.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
The autumn travelling took the company to Dover between 6 July and 4
August 1610, to Oxford in August, and to Shrewsbury and Stafford in
1609–10. During the following winter they gave fifteen Court plays on
unspecified days. They were playing a piece on the story of Richard
II, not now extant, at the Globe on 30 April 1611, and <i>A Winter’s
Tale</i> on 15 May.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> During 1611 Jonson’s <i>Catiline</i> was
produced, with a cast similar to that of <i>The Alchemist</i>, except
that Armin was replaced by Richard Robinson, whose earlier history is
unknown. Robinson, playing a female part, and Robert Gough also appear
in the stage directions of <i>The Second Maiden’s Tragedy</i>, licensed
for the stage by Sir George Buck on 31 October 1611. Gough was probably
one of Strange’s men in 1592. He appears in the wills of Pope in 1603
and of Phillips, who was his brother-in-law, in 1605, but with no
indication that he belonged to the King’s men. Beaumont and Fletcher’s
<i>A King and No King</i> was also licensed by Buck in 1611, and to
this year I assign Shakespeare’s <i>Tempest</i>. On 25 August 1611 the
interest in the Blackfriars originally intended for Sly was assigned
to Ostler. Ecclestone, on the other hand, later in the year than the
production of <i>Catiline</i>, but before 29 August, left the company
for the Lady Elizabeth’s men.</p>

<p>The only provincial visit by the King’s men recorded in 1610–11 was
to Shrewsbury. They gave twenty-two plays at Court during a rather
prolonged winter season extending from 31 October 1611 to 26 April
1612. Two of these, on 12 and 13 January, were joint performances with
the Queen’s men, and the plays used, Heywood’s <i>Silver Age</i> and
<i>Rape of Lucrece</i>, were from the repertory of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> The
King’s men also gave <i>The Tempest</i> and <i>A Winter’s Tale</i>,
<i>A King and No King</i>, Tourneur’s <i>The Nobleman</i>, and <i>The
Twins’ Tragedy</i>. On 20 February 1612 the actors’ moiety of the
Globe was again redistributed, into sevenths, so as to allow of the
admission as a housekeeper of Ostler, who had married a daughter of
Heminges. From the statement of the interests held by the parties to
this transaction, it is to be inferred that Heminges and Condell had
between them bought out since 1608 the representatives of Sly. On
21 April 1612 the company was at New Romney and at some date during
1611–12<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> at Winchester. Heminges received a payment for services to the
Lord Mayor’s pageant of this year, which was Dekker’s <i>Troja Nova
Triumphans</i>.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>The actor-list attached to <i>The Captain</i> in the Beaumont and
Fletcher Folio of 1679 probably belongs to the original production of
the play between 1609 and 1612. It names Burbadge, Condell, Cooke,
and Ostler. It was one of the plays selected for the Court season of
1612–13, during which, on 14 February, took place the wedding of the
Elector Palatine Frederick and the Princess Elizabeth, and which was
therefore singularly rich in plays, notwithstanding the interruption of
the festivities due to the death of Prince Henry on 7 November 1612.
Heminges lent a boy for Chapman’s mask on 15 February. The twenty
plays given this winter by the King’s men, the exact dates of which
are not upon record, were Shakespeare’s <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>
(performed twice), <i>The Tempest</i>, <i>A Winter’s Tale</i>,
<i>Julius Caesar</i>, <i>Othello</i>, and <i>1 and 2 Henry IV</i>,
Jonson’s <i>Alchemist</i>, Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>Philaster</i>
(also performed twice), <i>The Maid’s Tragedy</i>, <i>A King and No
King</i>, <i>The Captain</i> and the lost play of <i>Cardenio</i>,
Tourneur’s <i>Nobleman</i>, and four plays of unknown authorship,
<i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>, <i>The Knot of Fools</i>, <i>The
Twins’ Tragedy</i>, and <i>A Bad Beginning Makes a Good Ending</i>.
On 8 June there was a special performance of <i>Cardenio</i> for
the Savoyan ambassador. Some unknown cause seems to have brought
Shakespeare back in 1613 to the assistance of his fellows, and he
collaborated with Fletcher in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> and in
<i>Henry VIII</i> or <i>All is True</i>, possibly a revision of the
<i>Buckingham</i> which formed part of the repertory of Sussex’s men
in 1594. During a performance of <i>Henry VIII</i>, on 29 June 1613,
the Globe was burnt to the ground. Some contemporary verses mention
Burbadge, Heminges, and Condell as present on this occasion. A levy was
called for from the housekeepers to meet the cost of rebuilding, and
owing to the inability of the representatives of Augustine Phillips to
meet the call upon them, Heminges was enabled to recover one of the
alienated interests, which he divided with Condell.</p>

<p>The company was at Oxford before November in 1613, and also visited
Shrewsbury, Stafford, and Folkestone during 1612–13. They played
sixteen times at Court in the winter of 1613–14, on 1, 4, 5, 15, and
16 November and 27 December 1613, and on 1, 4, and 10 January, 2, 4,
8, 10, and 18 February and 6 and 8 March 1614. The rebuilding of the
Globe was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> complete by 30 June 1614, and in the course of 1613–14
the company visited Coventry. Cooke died in February 1614, being
then a sharer. Ostler died on 16 December, and his interests in the
Globe and Blackfriars became matter of dispute between his widow and
her father, John Heminges. The ascertained dates of Ostler’s career
render it possible to assign to 1609–14, the period of his connexion
with the King’s men, three plays in which he took part. These are
Webster’s <i>Duchess of Malfi</i>, at the first production of which,
if the actor-list of the 1623 edition is rightly interpreted, the
parts of Ferdinand, the Cardinal, and Antonio were played respectively
by Burbadge, Condell, and Ostler, Fletcher’s <i>Valentinian</i>,
played by Burbadge, Condell, Lowin, Ostler, and Underwood, and his
<i>Bonduca</i>, played by Burbadge, Condell, Lowin, Ostler, Underwood,
Tooley, Ecclestone, and Robinson. <i>Bonduca</i> must be either earlier
than Ecclestone’s departure for the Lady Elizabeth’s men in 1611, or
after he quitted that company and presumably rejoined the King’s in
1613.</p>

<p>The King’s men gave eight plays at Court on unspecified days during the
winter of 1614–15. On 29 March 1615 they were in trouble with other
companies for playing in Lent, and Heminges and Burbadge appeared on
their behalf before the Privy Council. In April 1615 they were at
Nottingham. They gave fourteen plays at Court between 1 November 1615
and 1 April 1616, and again the precise dates are not specified. They
also appeared before Anne at Somerset House on 21 December 1615.</p>

<p>Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, and with this event I must close my
detailed chronicle of the fortunes of the company. A new patent was
issued to them on 27 March 1619, probably to secure their right to
perform in the Blackfriars, which was being challenged by the action
of the City.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> Since 1603 Shakespeare, Phillips, Sly, Cowley,
Armin, and Fletcher have dropped out of the list, and are replaced by
Lowin, Underwood, Tooley, Ecclestone, Gough, and Robinson, together
with Nathan Field, Robert Benfield, and John Shank, who now appear
for the first time as members of the company.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Benfield and Field
are last traceable with the Lady Elizabeth’s men in 1613 and 1615
respectively, Shank with the Palsgrave’s men in 1613. The only names
common to both patents are those of Burbadge, Heminges, and Condell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
But in fact Burbadge died on 13 March 1619, while the patent was going
through its stages, and his place was almost immediately taken by
Joseph Taylor, from Prince Charles’s men. About the same time Field
left the company.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Heminges, described as ‘stuttering’ in 1613,
cannot be shown to have acted since the <i>Catiline</i> of 1611. He had
probably devoted himself to the business management of the company, in
which he always appears prominent. Condell also seems to have given up
acting about 1619, and during the rest of the history of the company
up to its extinction in 1642, its mainstays were Lowin and Taylor,
who became depositaries of the tradition of the great Shakespearian
parts. John Downes, who was prompter to the Duke of York’s men after
the Restoration, relates how, when Betterton played Hamlet, ‘Sir
<i>William</i> [Davenant] (having seen <i>Mr. Taylor</i> of the
<i>Black-Fryers</i> Company Act it, who being instructed by the Author
<i>Mr. Shakespear</i>) taught <i>Mr. Betterton</i> in every Particle
of it’; and how Davenant was similarly able to act as Betterton’s
tutor for Henry the Eighth, for he ‘had it from Old <i>Mr. Lowen</i>,
that had his Instructions from <i>Mr. Shakespear</i> himself’.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
When Heminges and Condell came to print Shakespeare’s plays in 1623,
they prefixed ‘the names of the principall Actors in all these playes’
as follows: ‘William Shakespeare, Richard Burbadge, John Hemmings,
Augustine Phillips, William Kempt, Thomas Poope, George Bryan, Henry
Condell, William Slye, Richard Cowly, John Lowine, Samuell Crosse,
Alexander Cooke, Samuel Gilburne, Robert Armin, William Ostler, Nathan
Field, John Underwood, Nicholas Tooley, William Ecclestone, Joseph
Taylor, Robert Benfield, Robert Goughe, Richard Robinson, John Shancke,
John Rice.’ The order is a little puzzling. The first ten entries may
be those of the original members of the Chamberlain’s company in 1594;
and if so, their order does not matter. But it is difficult to believe
that the other sixteen can represent either the order in which the
men began to play for the company, or the order in which they became
sharers. Of course, there may have been comings and goings known to
Heminges and Condell, but not now traceable. Thus Field and even Taylor
may have come for a short while and gone again before 1611. But it
seems impossible that Tooley, who was ‘fellow’ to Phillips in 1605,
could really have been junior to the recruits from the Queen’s Revels
in 1609. On the whole, one must suppose that, if Heminges and Condell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
aimed at an exact chronology, their memory occasionally failed them.
The omission from the Folio of Duke, Beeston, Sincler, and Sands may
indicate that the list is confined to sharers. It is probable that
Fletcher, who is also omitted, was not a sharer and did not act in any
Shakespearian play.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The first company under the patronage of this house had a long and
wholly provincial career.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> The earliest record of it is at
Barnstaple in 1555. On 10 October 1563 it was at Leicester. On 13 and
14 January 1565 it was at Sir George Vernon’s, Haddon Hall, Derbyshire,
under the leadership of one Hamond.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> It is further traceable in
December 1565 at Newcastle, before Michaelmas 1566 at Leicester,
in 1567–8 at Gloucester, in 1568–9 at Ipswich, Stratford-on-Avon,
and Bath, on 11 August 1569 at Nottingham, in 1569–70 and 1570–1 at
Gloucester and Barnstaple, in 1571 at Leicester and Beverley, on 9
January 1572 at Nottingham, before Michaelmas at Leicester, on 31
December 1572 at Wollaton, Notts. (Francis Willoughby’s), on 6 January
1573 at Nottingham, in 1572–3 at Bath, in 1573–4 at Abingdon, and in
January 1574 at Wollaton again. As the Earl of Worcester’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> eldest
son bore the courtesy title of Lord Herbert, it is probably the same
company which appeared at Leicester, after Michaelmas in 1574, as
‘Lorde Harbards’. But it is named as Worcester’s again in 1574–5 at
Stratford-on-Avon, on 28 April 1575 at Nottingham, and after Michaelmas
in the same year at Leicester, in 1575–6 at Coventry, in 1576–7 at
Stratford-on-Avon and Bath, and on 14 June 1577 at Southampton, where
it consisted of ten men. On 19 January 1578 it was at Nottingham, in
1577–8 at Coventry, in 1580–1 and 1581–2 at Stratford-on-Avon, in
1581–2 at Abingdon, on 15 June 1582 at Ipswich, in the same year at
Doncaster.</p>

<p>Two incidents in successive years suggest that Worcester’s men were not
always quite so amenable, as vagrants should have been, to municipal
discipline. The first was at Norwich on 7 June 1583. Here there was a
fear of plague, and the company were given 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, on
a promise not to play. In spite of this they played in their host’s
house. The Corporation ordered ‘that their lord shall be certified of
their contempt’, and that they should never again receive reward in
Norwich, and should presently depart the town on pain of imprisonment.
It was afterwards agreed, however, on submission and earnest entreaty,
not to report the misdemeanour to the Earl of Worcester. The second
occasion was in the following March in Leicester, and the entries in
the Corporation archives are so interesting as to deserve reproduction
in full.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="p-left">The latter part of this record is intelligible enough;
evidently there was a repetition of the misrule at Norwich. But
the earlier part, which refers to a different matter altogether,
is distinctly puzzling. The ‘theys’ in the first sentence of the
Corporation minute of 6 March are complicated, and it has sometimes
been supposed that there was really a company of Master of the Revels’
men, and that it was Worcester’s men who questioned the licence of
these.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> On the whole, I think that a different interpretation of
the documents is the more natural one. No doubt Worcester’s men had
found it necessary, as a result of the powers granted to Tilney as
Master of the Revels by the patent of 24 December 1581, to renew the
authority under which they travelled. In addition to a fresh warrant
from their lord licensing them to travel as his household servants,
and dated 14 January 1583, they obtained on the following 6 February a
further licence from Tilney, issued under the clause of his commission
which appointed him to ‘order and reforme, auctorise and put downe’ all
players in any part of England, whether they were ‘belonginge to any
noble man’ or otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> This licence, but not the other, they
left at their inn in Leicester, while passing through on some previous
occasion; and here it was found by some unlicensed players, who
appropriated it, and either through misunderstanding or through fraud,
imposed it upon the Corporation as an instrument constituting a Master
of the Revels’ company. There are two difficulties in this theory. One
is that George Haysell, to whom Tilney’s licence was issued, is not
one of the actors named in the Earl of Worcester’s warrant. But there
are other cases in which the constitution of a company in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> eyes
of its lord was not quite the same as its constitution from the point
of view of business relations, and I should suppose that Haysell, who
was evidently not himself acting at the time, was the financier of the
enterprise, and gave the bonds which Tilney would probably require for
the satisfaction of the covenants of his indenture of licence. The
other difficulty is that Leicester is not the only place in which the
presence of a Master of the Revels’ company is recorded. Such a company
was at Ludlow on 7 December 1583 and at Bath in 1583–4.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> But, after
all, this need mean no more than that the bogus company kept up their
fraud for two or three months before they were exposed. If Tilney had
really started a company of his own, it might have been expected to
have a longer life. The establishment in 1583 of the Queen’s men makes
it the less probable that he did so.</p>

<p>The list of this provincial company, as it stood in January 1583, is
interesting, because at least four of its members, Robert Browne,
Richard Jones, James Tunstall, and above all Edward Alleyn, then only
a lad of sixteen, were destined to take a considerable share in the
stage history of the future. Edward Browne, too, was afterwards one of
the Admiral’s men. Of the rest, William Harrison, Thomas Cooke, Richard
Andrewes, as well as of George Haysell (cf. ch. xv) and of the two
players who were not named in the warrant, Thomas Powlton and William
Pateson, Lord Herbert’s man, nothing or practically nothing further is
known.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> It is possible that the escapades of the company at Norwich
and Leicester came, after all, to Worcester’s ears and aroused his
displeasure. Visits are recorded to Coventry and Stratford in 1583–4,
to Maidstone in 1584–5, to York in March 1585, and thereafter no more.
It is also possible that the company passed from Worcester’s service
into that of Lord Howard, when the latter became Lord Admiral in 1585.
If so, a conveyance by Richard Jones to Edward Alleyn on 3 January 1589
of his share in a stock of apparel, play-books, and so forth, held
jointly with Edward and John Alleyn and Robert Browne, must relate, not
to a break up of Worcester’s men shortly before the death of the third
earl, but to some internal change in the organization of the Admiral’s
men.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> In any case Mr. Fleay’s theory that Worcester’s men, other
than Alleyn, became Pembroke’s in 1589 and only joined the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> Admiral’s
in 1594 is quite gratuitous, as there is no evidence of the existence
of Pembroke’s men before 1592.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Whether there was a Worcester’s
company or not from 1585 to 1589, there was certainly one after the
accession of the fourth earl. It is traceable at Coventry in 1589–90,
at Newcastle in October 1590, at Leicester during the last three months
of the same year, at Coventry and Faversham in 1590–1, at Leicester
on 26 June 1591 and again in the last three months of the year, at
Coventry and Shrewsbury in 1591–2, at Ipswich in 1592–3, twice at
Leicester in 1593, both before and after Michaelmas, twice at Bath in
1593–4, at Leicester before Michaelmas in 1595, at Ludlow on 3 December
1595, at Bath in 1595–6, at Leicester on 1 August 1596, at Bristol in
August 1598, at York in April 1599, and at Coventry on 3 January 1600
and in 1600–1 and 1601–2.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>By the end of 1601 the Earl of Worcester was holding the Mastership of
the Horse and other important offices at Court, and may have thought it
consonant with his dignity to have London players under his patronage.
On 3 January 1602 his company was at Court. On 31 March the Privy
Council, after attempting for some years to limit the number of London
companies to two, made an order that Oxford’s and Worcester’s men,
‘beinge ioyned by agrement togeather in on companie’, should be allowed
to play at the Boar’s Head and nowhere else.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> In the course of 1602
<i>How a Man may Choose a Good Wife from a Bad</i> was published as
played by Worcester’s men. By 17 August the company were in relations,
under the style of ‘my lorde of Worsters players’, with Henslowe, who
opened an account of advances made for their play-books and apparel,
on the same lines as that which he kept during 1597–1603 with the
Admiral’s men.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> An early entry is of 9<i>s.</i> for a supper ‘at
the Mermayd when we weare at owre a grement’. The account was continued
until the spring of 1603, when Henslowe’s famous diary was disused.
No theatre is named, but it is probable that, with or without leave
from the Privy Council, the company moved to the Rose, which had been
vacated by the Admiral’s men on the opening of the Fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> in 1600.
Certainly this was so by May 1603, when an acquittance for an advance
entered in the account refers to a play to be written for ‘the Earle
of Worcesters players at the Rose’.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> There is no complete list
of the company in the diary. The names of those members incidentally
mentioned, as authorizing payments or otherwise, are John Duke, Thomas
Blackwood, William Kempe, John Thare, John Lowin, Thomas Heywood,
Christopher Beeston, Robert Pallant, and a Cattanes whose first name
is not preserved. The payees for the performance of 1601–2 were Kempe
and Heywood. One Underell was in receipt of wages from the company,
together with a tireman, who made purchases of stuffs for them. It
is impossible to say which of these men had been with Worcester’s
and which with Oxford’s before the amalgamation. Heywood, who was
playwright as well as actor, had written for the Admiral’s from 1596 to
1599, and had bound himself to play in Henslowe’s house for two years
from 25 March 1598. Pallant had been with Strange’s or the Admiral’s in
1590–1, and Duke, Kempe, and Beeston with the Chamberlain’s in 1598.
Since then Kempe had travelled abroad, returning in September 1601. It
is little more than a guess that some of these men may have played with
Henslowe as Pembroke’s.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Several members of the company borrowed
money from Henslowe, in some cases before their connexion with the
Rose began. Duke had a loan as early as 21 September 1600, and Kempe
on 10 March 1602.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Blackwood and Lowin borrowed on 12 March 1603
to go into the country with the company.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> This was, no doubt, when
playing in London was suspended owing to the illness of Elizabeth.
A loan for a similar purpose was made on the same day to Richard
Perkins, and suggests that he too was already one of Worcester’s men.
There is, indeed, an earlier note of 4 September 1602 connecting him
with one Dick Syferweste, whose fellows were then in the country,
while Worcester’s were, of course, at the Rose. But this itself makes
it clear that he was interested in a play of Heywood’s, which can
hardly be other than that then in preparation at the Rose, and perhaps
Syferwest was an unfortunate comrade in Oxford’s or Worcester’s, who
had been left out at the reconstruction.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span></p>

<p>During the seven months of the account Worcester’s men bought twelve
new plays. These were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>A Medicine for a Curst Wife</i> (Dekker).</li>
  <li><i>Albere Galles</i> (Heywood and Smith).</li>
  <li><i>Marshal Osric</i> (Heywood and Smith).</li>
  <li><i>The Three Brothers</i> (Smith).<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>1 Lady Jane</i>, or, <i>The Overthrow of Rebels</i><a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
(Chettle, Dekker, Heywood, Smith, and Webster).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>Christmas Comes but Once a Year</i> (Chettle, Dekker,
Heywood, and Webster).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>1 The Black Dog of Newgate</i> (Day, Hathaway, Smith, and
another).</li>
  <li><i>The Blind Eats Many a Fly</i> (Heywood).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>The Unfortunate General</i> (Day, Hathaway, and Smith).</li>
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>2 The Black Dog of Newgate</i> (Day, Hathaway, Smith, and
another).</li>
  <li><i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i> (Heywood).</li>
  <li><i>The Italian Tragedy</i> (Smith).</li>
</ul>

<p class="p-left">As a rule the price was £6 a play; occasionally £1 or £2 more. Dekker
had 10<i>s.</i> ‘over &amp; above his price of’ <i>A Medicine for a Curst
Wife</i>. This had originally been begun for the Admiral’s and was
evidently transferred to Worcester’s by arrangement. After buying <i>2
Black Dog of Newgate</i> for £7, the company apparently did not like
it, and paid £2 more for ‘adycyones’. It is possible to verify from the
purchase of properties the performance of nine of the twelve plays.
These are <i>Albere Galles</i> (September), <i>The Three Brothers</i>
(October), <i>Marshal Osric</i> (November), <i>1 Lady Jane</i>
(November), <i>Christmas Comes but Once a Year</i> (December), <i>1
Black Dog of Newgate</i> (January), <i>The Unfortunate General</i>
(January), <i>2 Black Dog of Newgate</i> (February), and <i>A Woman
Killed with Kindness</i> (March). The production of this last may,
however, have been interfered with by Elizabeth’s death. Two plays of
the series are extant, <i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i>, printed in
1607 and described in 1617 as a Queen’s play, and <i>1 Lady Jane</i>,
which may be reasonably identified with <i>Sir Thomas Wyatt</i>,
also printed in 1607 as a Queen’s play, and by Dekker and Webster.
Dr. Greg regards Mr. Fleay’s identification of <i>Albere Galles</i>
with <i>Nobody and Somebody</i> as ‘reasonable’; but it appears to
rest on little, except the fact that the latter was also printed as a
Queen’s play (S. R. 12 March 1606) and the conjecture that the title
of the former might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> be a corruption of <i>Archigallo</i>. Payments
were made in respect of a few contemplated plays, which apparently
remained incomplete at the end of the season. These were <i>2 Lady
Jane</i> (Dekker), an unnamed tragedy by Chettle, an unnamed play by
Middleton, and another unnamed play by Chettle and Heywood. The company
also produced some plays of earlier date. <i>Sir John Oldcastle</i>
was presumably transferred to them from the Admiral’s men, for Dekker
had £2 10<i>s.</i> in respect of new additions to it in August and
September. Heywood also had £1 in September for additions to a play
called <i>Cutting Dick</i>, as to the origin of which nothing is known;
and properties were bought in October for <i>Byron</i><a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and for
<i>Absalom</i>. Possibly the latter is identical with <i>The Three
Brothers</i>. Worcester’s men did not perform at Court in 1602–3,
but they must have expected a summons, as on 1 January they bought
head-tires of one Mrs. Calle ‘for the corte’. Amongst their tradesmen
were also Goodman Freshwater, who supplied ‘a canvas sewt and skenes’,
apparently for a stage dog, and John Willett, mercer, on whose arrest
John Duke found himself in the Clink at the end of the season. Their
expenditure was at a fairly high rate, amounting to a total of £234
11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the seven months. Unlike the Admiral’s men,
they spent more on apparel and properties than on play-books. Some
of their purchases were costly enough, ‘a grogren clocke, ij veluet
gerkens, ij dubletes and ij hed tyres’ from Edward Alleyn for £20, ‘a
manes gowne of branshed velluet &amp; a dublett’ from Christopher Beeston
for £6, and ‘iiij clothe clockes layd with coper lace’ from Robert
Shaw, formerly of the Admiral’s, for £16. On this last transaction they
had to allow Henslowe £1 as interest on his money. A ‘flage of sylke’,
no doubt for the theatre roof, cost them £1 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i><a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>
In summing his account, Henslowe made various errors, whereby he robbed
himself of £1 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, and presented a claim to the
company for £140 1<i>s.</i> It may be inferred that they had already
repaid him £93 12<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, but of this there is no record
in the diary. He prepared an acknowledgement to be signed by all the
members of the company, but the only signature actually attached is
Blackwode’s.</p>

<p>On 9 May 1603 Henslowe notes ‘Begininge to playe agayne by the Kynges
licence &amp; layd out sense for my lord of Worsters men as folowethe’; but
the only entry is one of £2 paid in earnest to Chettle and Day for a
play of <i>Shore’s Wife</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> If playing was actually resumed, it was
not long before the plague drove the companies out of London again,
and there is nothing more of Worcester’s men in the diary. Two visits
from them are recorded at Leicester in the course of 1603, and two at
Coventry and one at Barnstaple, whence they departed without playing,
during 1602–3. Early in the new reign the company was taken into the
patronage of Queen Anne.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> This change was probably effected by
Christmas, and certainly by 19 February 1604, when John Duke obtained
a warrant on account of plays performed before Prince Henry by ‘the
Queenes Majesties players’ on the previous 2 and 13 January. The
Queen’s men are named in the Privy Council letter permitting the
resumption of playing on 9 April 1604, which indicates their house as
the Curtain. A list of players is found amongst other ‘officers to
the Queene’ receiving four and a half yards of red cloth apiece for
the coronation procession of 15 March 1604.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> The names given are
‘Christopher Beeston, Robert Lee, John Duke, Robert Palante, Richard
Purkins, Thomas Haward, James Houlte, Thomas Swetherton, Thomas Grene,
and Robert Beeston’. Evidently several leading members had left the
company. Kempe was probably dead.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> Thare and Blackwood were on tour
in Germany; Lowin seems to have joined the King’s men. Of Cattanes and
Underell no more is known. The same ten names are found in a draft
patent for a royal licence to the Queen’s men, of which the text
follows:<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">This draft is undated. But it was prepared during a plague, and located
the Queen’s men at the Boar’s Head; and as they may reasonably be
supposed to have exchanged the Boar’s Head for the Red Bull (q.v.)
before the plague of 1606 began, it may be conjecturally assigned to
that of 1603–4. Probably it never passed the Great Seal, for if it had
there would have been no necessity, so far as one can judge, for a
later patent of 15 April 1609, which is on the rolls, and which closely
follows the earlier draft in its terms, except that it omits the
reference to the plague, names the Red Bull instead of the Boar’s Head
as one of the company’s regular houses, and adds a saving clause for

<p class="p-left">It will be observed that the documents quoted disclose no change in the
composition of the Queen’s official servants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> between 1604 and 1609.
But the question of <i>personnel</i> is not really quite so simple
as this, since the members of a company under a trade agreement were
not always the same as those named in the authority under which it
performed. Before discussing this complication, it will be simplest
first to set out separately the notices of the Queen’s men, which have
been preserved in London and in provincial records respectively.</p>

<p>Queen’s men played at Court on 30 December 1605, in Heywood’s <i>How
to Learn of a Woman to Woo</i>, which is not extant. They played also
on 27 December 1606. For both years their payee was, as in 1604, John
Duke. During 1607 Dekker and Webster’s <i>Sir Thomas Wyatt</i> and
Day, Wilkins, and Rowley’s <i>Travels of Three English Brothers</i>
were printed with their name on the title-pages. The latter play,
according to the entry of 29 June 1607 in the Stationers’ Register, was
acted at the Curtain. But it is shown by a passage in <i>The Knight
of the Burning Pestle</i> to have been also on the stage of the Red
Bull. In this house Thomas Swinnerton, one of the men named in the
patents, acquired an interest between 24 March 1605 and 23 March 1606,
and all the evidence is in favour of a continuous sojourn of Queen’s
men there until 1617. The first quarto of Heywood’s <i>A Woman Killed
with Kindness</i>, also printed in 1607, does not bear their name, but
it is on that of the ‘third edition’ of 1617. They are not named as
playing at Court during the winter of 1607–8, but in the course of 1608
Heywood’s <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> was printed, as played by them at the
Red Bull. They gave five plays at Court in the winter of 1608–9, one on
27 December 1609, three on 10 and one on 27 December 1610. Heywood’s
<i>Golden Age</i> was printed, as played by them at the Red Bull, in
1611. The Court records of 1611–12 are a little confused.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> But they
appear to have played Cooke’s <i>City Gallant</i> on 27 December, his
<i>Tu Quoque</i>, which is in fact the same play, on 2 February, to
have joined with the King’s men in performances of Heywood’s <i>Silver
Age</i> and <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> on 12 and 13 January, and to have
played unnamed pieces on 21 and 23 January. From 1609 to 1612 their
payee was Thomas Greene. Webster’s <i>White Devil</i> and Dekker’s
<i>If It be not Good, the Devil is in It</i>, were printed as theirs in
1612, the former with a laudation of the acting of ‘my freind Maister
Perkins’, the latter as played at the Red Bull. They did not play
at Court during the winter of 1612–13, but did on 24 December 1613
and 5 January 1614. <i>Tu Quoque</i> was printed as theirs in 1614.
In the winter of 1614–15 they gave three plays at Court. Heywood’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
<i>Four Prentices of London</i> was printed in 1615 as played by them
at the Red Bull, and their name is also on <i>The Honest Lawyer</i>,
registered on 14 August 1615 and printed in 1616. They gave four plays
at Court during the winter of 1615–16. For all their Court plays from
1613–16 Robert Lee was payee, but Ellis Worth replaces him for a
Somerset House performance before Queen Anne on 17 December 1615. When
they were called with other companies before the Privy Council on 29
March 1615 to answer for playing in Lent, they were represented by Lee
and Christopher Beeston. The records of the Middlesex justices contain
a note of 4 October 1616 that Beeston and the rest of the players at
the Red Bull were in arrears to the extent of £5 on an annual rate of
£2 agreed to by them for the repair of the highways.</p>

(perhaps twice); on 15 April 1615 at Coventry; in April or May 1615 at
Leicester; on 6 May 1615 at Norwich;<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> on 16 October 1615 and again
later in 1615 and on 22 February 1616 at Leicester;<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> on 7 November
1615 at Marlborough; in 1615–16 at Barnstaple, Dunwich (thrice),
Southampton, and Weymouth; in January 1616 at Nottingham; between 20
January and 17 February 1616 and between 11 May and 8 June at Dover; on
17 February 1616 at Coventry; on 22 February 1616 at Leicester; between
1 and 6 April (four days) and on 29 May 1616 at Norwich;<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> on 26
October 1616 at Marlborough; and on 6 February 1617 and again later in
1617 at Leicester.<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>There were thus tours in each year, which sometimes extended over
periods during which the London theatres must have been open. The
Leicester notices of 1608, 1615, and 1617 suggest that more than
one company was at work, and the explanation certainly is that some
of the players named in the patent, instead of joining the London
organization, had recourse to making up companies of their own for
provincial purposes. Of this there is further evidence. The Southampton
archives contain a copy of the following warrant from Queen Anne
herself, dated on 7 March 1606:<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">Of these three men, Lee, and Lee alone, appears in the London lists
of 1603, 1604, and 1609. Of Barfield’s career nothing more is known.
Martin Slater, whose name can be divined under that of Statier, had
left the Admiral’s in 1597. He was probably in Scotland during 1599,
and if so his patronage by Anne may be analogous to the patronage by
James, which brought Laurence Fletcher’s name into the King’s men’s
patent. In 1603 he was payee for Hertford’s men. Presumably the
enterprise of 1606 did not last long, for in the spring of 1608 Slater
became manager for the King’s Revels. His place in the provinces may
have been taken by Thomas Swinnerton, who was leading a company of
Queen’s men at Coventry in 1608–9, and whose departure from the London
company is perhaps indicated by the fact that at about the same time
he sold a share, which he had held in the house of the Red Bull.
Swinnerton was travelling again in 1614–16 and using an exemplification
of the patent of 1609. In 1616 he was accompanied by Robert Lee, who
for two years before had been acting as payee for the London company.
Lee came again with the exemplification to Norwich on 31 May 1617, and
it was then noted to have been taken out on 7 January 1612. A few days
later, on 4 June 1617, a copy was entered in the Norwich court books
of a warrant by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> Lord Chamberlain of 16 July 1616, condemning the
use of such exemplifications, and specifying amongst others two taken
out by Thomas Swinnerton and Martin Slater, ‘beinge two of the Queens
Maiesties company of Playors hauing separated themselves from their
said Company’.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Slater had, therefore, returned to the provincial
field, and there were now two travelling companies of Queen’s men. I
take it that in 1617 the Lord Chamberlain succeeded in suppressing
them, and that the Queen’s men who continued to appear in the provinces
up to Anne’s death on 2 March 1619 were the London company.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> Lee
joined the Queen’s Revels as reorganized under a licence of 31 October
1617. Slater, about the same time, joined the Children of Bristol,
for whom, with John Edmonds and Nathaniel Clay, he got letters of
assistance in April 1618. In these all three are described as her
Majesty’s servants. Swinnerton apparently succeeded in keeping on foot
a company of his own, which visited Leicester in 1619.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> The Bristol
company was in fact under Anne’s patronage, but Lee and Swinnerton,
no less than Slater and Edmonds, remained technically the Queen’s
servants, and are included with the London men in a list of the players
who received mourning at her funeral on 13 May 1619.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> These were
Robert Lee, Richard Perkins, Christopher Beeston, Robert Pallant,
Thomas Heywood, James Holt, Thomas Swinnerton, Martin Slater, Ellis
Wroth, John Comber, Thomas Basse, John Blaney, William Robinson, John
Edmonds, Thomas Drewe, Gregory Sanderson, and John Garret.</p>

<p>The list of seventeen names includes seven of the ten patentees of
1609. I do not know what had become of John Duke and Robert Beeston.
Thomas Greene had died in August 1612, having made on 25 July a will,
amongst the witnesses to which were Christopher Beeston, Heywood,
and Perkins. The disposal of his property led many years afterwards
to a lawsuit, which gives valuable information as to both the
<i>personnel</i> and the organization of the London company. After
providing for his family and making some small legacies, including one
to John Cumber, and 40<i>s.</i> to ‘my fellowes of the house of the
Redd Bull, to buy gloves for them’, he left the residue to his widow
and executrix, Susanna Greene, formerly wife of one Browne.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> In
June 1613 she took a third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> husband, James Baskervile. The following
is her account in 1623 of certain transactions with the company.
Shortly before Greene’s death had died George Pulham, a ‘half sharer’
in the company, which is described as being in 1612 ‘the companie of
the actors or players of the late queenes majestie Queene Anne, then
vsuallie frequentinge and playinge att the signe of the Redd Bull in
St. Johns Street, in Clerkenwell parishe, in the county of Middlesex’.
His representatives received £40 from the company in respect of his
half-share. This was under an agreement formerly made amongst the
company ‘concerninge the part and share of euerie one of the sharers
and half sharers of the said companie according to the rate and
proporcion of their shares or half shares in that behalfe’. Under the
same agreement Susanna Greene, whose husband was ‘one of the principall
and cheif persons of the said companie, and a full adventurer, storer
and sharer of in and amongst them’, claimed £80, together with £37
laid out by him before his death in ‘diuers necessarie prouisions’
for the company. In order to get satisfaction she had to appeal to
Viscount Lisle, Chamberlain of the Queen’s Household, ‘who hadd a
kind of gouernment and suruey ouer the said players’. It was arranged
that Mrs. Greene should receive a half-share in the profits until the
debt was paid. By the time, however, of her marriage with Baskervile,
she had only received £6. In June 1615 negotiations took place
between the Baskerviles and the company, who then included Worth,
Perkins, and Christopher Hutchinson, <i>alias</i> Beeston, by which
the Baskerviles agreed to invest £57 10<i>s.</i> in the enterprise
and to accept in discharge of their claims a pension for their joint
lives of 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a day ‘for euerye of sixe daies in the
weeke wherin they should play’. The company defaulted, and in June
1616 a second settlement was made, whereby the Baskerviles invested
another £38, a further pension of 2<i>s.</i> a day was established,
and the life of Susan’s son, Francis Browne (or Baskervile), was
substituted for her husband’s. The players were Christopher Beeston,
Thomas Heywood, Ellis Worth, John Cumber, John Blaney, Francis Walpole,
Robert Reynolds, William Robins, Thomas Drewe, and Emanuel Read.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
Again they defaulted, and moreover fell into arrear for the wages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
another of Susan Baskervile’s sons, William Browne, who played with
them as a hired man. A third settlement, reassuring the pensions,
and substituting William Browne for Francis, who was now dead, was
made on 3 June 1617, when the company were ‘now comme, or shortlie to
comme from the said Playhowse called the Redd Bull to the Playhowse
in Drurie Lane called the Cockpitt’; and to this the parties, so
far as the company were concerned, were Beeston, Heywood, Worth,
Cumber, Walpole, Blaney, Robins, and Drewe. Apparently Reynolds and
Read, and also Perkins and Thomas Basse, although their names were
recited in the deed, refused to seal. Some further light is thrown
on this by allegations of Worth, Cumber, and Blaney, in opposition
to those of Mrs. Baskervile in 1623. The company of 1617 contained
some members ‘new come into’ it, ‘which were of other companyes at
the tyme of graunting the first annuity’. The terms of the agreement
were carefully looked into, and were found to bind the company to
procure the subscription of any future new members to its terms. This
was inconsistent with a proviso of 1616 that the pensions should only
last so long as four of those then signing should play together; and
therefore, while some of the company signed and gave bonds by way of
security on an oral promise by Mrs. Baskervile that this proviso should
in fact hold good, others refused to do so. These were the wiser, for
in 1623, when Worth, Cumber, and Blaney were the only three of the 1617
signatories who still held together, Mrs. Baskervile sued them on their
bonds, and although they applied to Chancery for equitable enforcement
of the alleged oral promise, Chancery held that the agreement, being
made between players, was ‘vnfitt to be releeued or countenaunced in a
courte of equitie’. In some other respects the players’ account of the
transactions differs from Mrs. Baskervile’s, and in particular they
alleged that the Baskerviles had secured their interest by bribing
Beeston, to whom ‘your oratours and the rest of thier fellowes at
that tyme and long before and since did put the managing of thier
whole businesses and affaires belonging vnto them ioyntly as they were
players in trust’, so that she knew well that whatever he promised
the rest ‘would allowe of the same’. This Mrs. Baskervile repudiates
as regards the bribe, and does not wholly accept as regards Beeston’s
position in the company, although she admits that both before and
after her husband’s death they ‘did putt much affiance in the said
Huttchinson alias Beeston, concerninge the managing of their affaires’.</p>

<p>I am afraid that Beeston’s character does not come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> altogether
unstained out of another suit brought by one John Smith in the Court of
Requests during 1619 for a sum of £46 5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in respect
of ‘tinsell stuffes and other stuffe’ delivered on Beeston’s order to
Worth, Perkins, Cumber, and others at the Red Bull between 27 June
1612 and 23 February 1617, since when they had ‘fallen at variance and
strife amongst themselves and separated and devided themselves into
other companies.’ He accuses these four men of conspiring to keep him
out of payment. Worth, Perkins, and Cumber asserted that the liability
was Beeston’s. The company had ‘required divers officers and that
every of the said actors should take vpon them some place &amp; charge’.
Beeston was charged with the provision of furniture and apparel, which
needed ‘a thriueing man &amp; one that was of abilitie &amp; meanes’. He was
to ‘defaulke outt of the colleccions and gatheringes which were made
continually when-soeuer any playe was acted a certen some of money as a
comon stock.’ to pay for purchases out of this, and to account to the
company for the balance. No one else was privy to his transactions. The
arrangement lasted for seven or eight years, and they believe that he
‘much enritched himself and rendered a false account for expenditure
of £400. He is now conspiring with Smith and hoping for a chance to
‘exclayme on’ them. If he incurred debt, he had certainly taken funds
to meet it. From the beginning he had ‘a greater care for his owne
privatt gaine’. Now he has ‘of late given over his coate &amp; condicion &amp;
separated and devided himself’ from the company, carrying away all the
furniture and apparel. Beeston says that he has long been ill. On Queen
Anne’s death he left the company and joined Prince Charles’s men. The
Queen’s had ten sharers, and sometimes one, sometimes another, provided
the clothes. He denies liability. Several witnesses, including William
Freshwater, merchant tailor and ‘a workman to the said company’, spoke
to Beeston’s liability.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> One John King says that the company
allowed Beeston ‘one half of the profitt that came of the gallyryes’,
and that they began to break up about three years ago. At a hearing on
16 June 1620 Beeston got the case deferred on the ground that Emanuel
Read, a material witness, was in Ireland until Michaelmas. Elizabeth,
the wife of Richard Perkins, said that Read had been there for two or
three years, was over at Easter, and was not expected again. Smith
got in a blow at Beeston’s credit with an affidavit that he had said
‘it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> nothing for him to put in a false answere into the Court of
Requestes, for that it was not punishable’. The result of the suit is
unknown.</p>

<p>We may perhaps reach the following conclusions as to the composition
of the London company after the deaths in 1612 of Pulham, presumably
a recent comer since 1609, and Greene. Their nucleus consisted of two
of the patented men, Christopher Beeston and Heywood, who probably
remained with them throughout. Of the other patentees, Swinnerton kept
to the provinces. Lee had rejoined them from the provinces by 1613
or 1614, and went back to the provinces about May 1616. Perkins was
apparently not of their number in June 1616, but was in June 1617.
Holt is not traceable; perhaps he also went to the provinces. Pallant
joined the Lady Elizabeth’s in 1614 and had passed to Prince Charles’s
by 1616. All these five men, however, appear with Beeston and Heywood
as Anne’s servants at her funeral. Here too are Slater and Edmonds,
then of the Bristol, and apparently never of the London company; also
Worth, Cumber, Blaney, Drewe, and Robinson, presumably identical with
Robins, all of whom had joined the London company by June 1616, Basse,
formerly of the Lady Elizabeth’s, who joined it between June 1616
and June 1617, and Gregory Sanderson and John Garret, who, if they
belonged to the London company at all, must have joined it after June
1617.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> The list does not contain the names of two men who belonged
to the company in 1616 and 1617. One was Emanuel Read, who joined it
from the Lady Elizabeth’s in 1613 or later; the other, Robert Reynolds,
whose attachment to the company must have been rather loose, as he was
travelling in Germany in July 1616 and again in 1618. Evidently, as the
lawsuits suggest, the organization of the Queen’s men during its later
years was rather unstable. Into its attempts to hold together after
Anne’s death and the after-careers of its members, it is not necessary
to go.</p>

<p>In June 1617 the Queen’s were come, or shortly to come, from the Red
Bull to the Cockpit. In fact they were at the Cockpit, then a new
house, on 4 March 1617, when it was sacked by prentices in a Shrovetide
riot.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> But they may have returned to the Red Bull for a time, while
the Cockpit was being repaired, as they did again after they lost it
on the separation from Christopher Beeston, who seems to have been its
owner, in 1619.</p>

<h5>xxii. THE DUKE OF LENNOX’S MEN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ludovic Stuart, s. of Esmé, 1st Duke of Lennox; cousin and until
1594 heir presumptive of James; <i>nat.</i> 29 Sept. 1574;
succ. as 2nd Duke, 26 May 1583; Gentleman of Bedchamber, 1603;
Earl of Richmond, 6 Oct. 1613; Lord Steward, Nov. 1615; Duke of
Richmond, 17 Aug. 1623; o.s.p. 16 Feb. 1624.</p>
</div>

<p>The first notice of Lennox’s men is on 13 October 1604, when he gave
an open warrant of assistance in their behalf addressed to mayors,
justices, and other local officers, some of whom had apparently refused
the company permission to play (App. D, no. cxxxvii). On 16 March
1605 Francis Henslowe gave his uncle Philip a bond of £60 to observe
articles of an agreement he had entered into with John Garland and
Abraham Savere ‘his ffellowes, servantes to the most noble Prince the
duke of Lennox’; and on 1 March 1605 Savere had given Francis Henslowe
a power of attorney to recover £40 on a forfeited bond from John
Garland of ‘the ould forde’, securing delivery of a warrant made to
Savere by Lennox (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 62). Some other traces point
to a connexion between Savere and Francis Henslowe, which was ended by
the latter’s death in the middle of 1606 (Henslowe, ii. 277), and an
undated loan of £7 by Philip Henslowe to his nephew ‘to goyne with owld
Garlland and Symcockes and Saverey when they played in the duckes nam
at ther laste goinge owt’ (Henslowe, i. 160) makes it possible to add
one more to the list of the company. It does not seem to have played in
London, but is traceable at Canterbury in 1603–4, Barnstaple, Coventry,
and Norwich in 1604–5, and Coventry again in 1607–8. Both Garland and
Henslowe had been Queen Elizabeth’s men, and it is possible that,
when these men were left stranded by her death in 1603, they found a
new patron in Lennox. John Garland had joined the Duke of York’s men
by 1610, and it has been suggested that this company may have been a
continuation of Lennox’s.</p>

<p>A company under the patronage of Prince Charles, then Duke of York,
first makes its appearance during 1608, and in the provinces. A visit
of ‘the younger princes’ men to Ipswich is recorded on 20 October.
During 1608–9 the company was also at Bath, and it is at least possible
that it was ‘the Princes players of the White Chapple London’ rewarded
at Leicester in 1608. The Boar’s Head (q.v.) may have been roughly
spoken of as in Whitechapel, and although there is no proof that the
Duke of York’s men occupied it after the Queen’s moved to the Red Bull,
there is nothing to connect them during the earlier years of their
career with any of the better-known London houses. On 30 March 1610
they received, like other London companies, a patent, of which the
following are the terms:<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">The only member of the Duke of York’s men, of whose previous history
anything is known, is John Garland. He was of the Duke of Lennox’s men
in 1605. Perhaps the whole company was taken over from the Duke of
Lennox. Mr. Fleay says that the Duke of York’s men arose ‘immediately
after the disappearance of the King’s Revels Children’,<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> and
appears to suggest a continuity between the two companies; but he
must have overlooked the fact that the Duke of York’s were already
performing in the provinces, while the King’s Revels were in all
probability still at Whitefriars.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>Some reconstruction doubtless took place about the date of the issue
of the patent, for the pleadings in the equity suit of <i>Taylor v.
Hemynges</i> in 1612 recites an agreement of 15 March 1610, which
provided for the continuance of fellowship during three years and the
forfeiture of the interest in a common stock of ‘apparrell goodes
money and other thinges’ of any member, who left without the consent
of the rest. It was made between Garland on the one side and Taylor,
Rowley, Dawes, and Hobbes on the other, and these four gave Garland a
bond of £200 as security. On 8 May the five bought some ‘olde clothes
or apparrell which formerly weare players clothes or apparrell’ from
John Heminges of the King’s men for £11, and gave a bond of £20 for
payment. Apparently payment had not been made by Easter 1611, when
Taylor ‘by the licence and leave of his said Master the Duke vpon some
speciall reason ... did give over and leave to play in the company’.
Under the agreement the apparel passed to his fellows, and according
to Taylor they paid Heminges the £11 or otherwise satisfied him, and
then ‘havinge conceaued some vndeserued displeasure’ against Taylor
for leaving them, conspired with Heminges to defraud him of £20 on the
bond. According to Heminges no payment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> was made, and he sued Taylor
as ‘the best able to paye and discharge the same’. Taylor was arrested
and in February 1612 brought his suit in equity to stay the common law
proceedings. The result is unknown.</p>

<p>The company frequently played at Court, but, as it would seem, only
before the younger members of the royal family. Their first appearance
was before Charles and Elizabeth on 9 February 1610. In 1610–11 they
were at Saffron Walden. They came before Charles and Elizabeth on 12
and 20 December 1610 and 15 January 1611, and before Henry, Charles,
and Elizabeth on 12 and 28 January and 13 and 24 February 1612. On
this last occasion they played William Rowley’s <i>Hymen’s Holiday, or
Cupid’s Vagaries</i>. After Henry’s death, on 7 November 1612, they
became entitled to the designation of the Prince’s players. In 1612–13
they were at Barnstaple and Ipswich. On 2 and 10 March 1613 they gave
the two parts of <i>The Knaves</i>, perhaps by Rowley, before Charles,
Elizabeth, and the Palsgrave. In 1613–14 they were at Barnstaple,
Dover, Saffron Walden, and Coventry. They were not at Court for the
winter of 1613–14. In November 1614 they were at Oxford, Leicester,
and Nottingham. At the Christmas of 1614–15 they gave six plays before
Charles, and on 11 February they were at Youghal in Ireland. Ten days
later R. A.’s <i>The Valiant Welshman</i> was entered and in the
course of the year published as theirs. Their leader seems to have
been Rowley. He both wrote plays for them and acted as payee for all
their court rewards from 1610 to 1614. In 1611 they lost Taylor and in
1614 Dawes to the Lady Elizabeth’s men; and these transferences seem
to have led to a temporary amalgamation of the two companies, which
Mr. Fleay and Dr. Greg place in 1614, but for which their distinct
appearances at Court in the following winter suggest 1615 as the more
likely date.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> On 29 March 1615 William Rowley and John Newton were
called with representatives of other companies before the Privy Council
to answer for playing in Lent. No separate representation of the Lady
Elizabeth’s is indicated by the list. In 1614–15 the Prince’s were
at Norwich, Coventry, Winchester, and Barnstaple. In the winter of
1615–16 they gave four plays before Prince Charles, and the payee was
not Rowley, but Alexander Foster, formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> of the Lady Elizabeth’s.
Rosseter’s patent of 3 June 1615 for a second Blackfriars theatre
contemplates its use by the Prince’s men and the Lady Elizabeth’s, as
well as by the Queen’s Revels, and Field’s <i>Amends for Ladies</i>
was actually played in the Blackfriars, probably in this house before
it was suppressed, by the two first-named companies. After Henslowe’s
death on 6 January 1616, the combination, whatever its nature, was
probably broken up, and separate companies of Prince’s men and Lady
Elizabeth’s men were again formed. But both of the original companies
continued to be represented in one which remained at the Hope. This
is shown by an agreement entered into with Alleyn and Meade on 20
March 1616, and signed in the presence of Robert Daborne and others
by William Rowley, Robert Pallant, Joseph Taylor, Robert Hamlen, John
Newton, William Barksted, Thomas Hobbes, Antony Smith, William Penn,
and Hugh Attwell.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> This recites that the signatories and others had
given bonds to Henslowe and Meade for the repayment of sums lent them
by Henslowe, for a stock of apparel worth £400, and for the fulfilment
of certain Articles of Agreement; and that at their entreaty Alleyn
had agreed to accept £200 in discharge of their full liabilities. They
covenant to pay the £200 by making over to Alleyn one-fourth of the
daily takings of the whole galleries at the Hope or any house in which
they may play, and to carry out the Articles with Alleyn and Meade by
so playing. Alleyn and Meade agree to cancel the bonds when the £200
is paid, except any which may relate to private debts of any of the
men to Henslowe, and also to make over to them any apparel which they
had received from Henslowe, Alleyn, or Meade. The rights of Alleyn and
Meade against any bondsmen not taking part in the new agreement are to
remain unaffected. That the signatories to this document used the name
of Prince Charles’s men seems pretty clear from the reappearance of
several of their names in two later lists of the Prince’s men, one in
Rowley and Middleton’s <i>Mask of Heroes</i> (1619), the other in the
records of King James’s funeral on 20 May 1625.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> This last contains
also the name of Gilbert Reason, who is not one of the signatories of
1616, but was in that year travelling the provinces with an irregularly
obtained exemplification of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span> the 1610 patent.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> An undated letter
from Pallant, Rowley, Taylor, Newton, Hamlen, Attwell, and Smith to
Alleyn, which may belong to some time in 1616 or 1617, shows that, in
spite of the easy terms which the company seem to have received by the
agreement, the subsequent relations were not altogether smooth. They
write to excuse their removal from the Bankside, where they had stood
the intemperate weather, until ‘more intemperate Mr. Meade thrust vs
over, taking the day from vs w<sup>ch</sup> by course was ours’. They ask
Alleyn to find them a house and in the meantime to lend them £40, on
the security that ‘we haue to receiue from the court (w<sup>ch</sup> after
Shrouetide wee meane to pursue w<sup>th</sup> best speede) a great summe of
monie’, amounting to more than twice the loan desired.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> It is to be
presumed that the ‘course’ to which they refer was some distribution of
days between playing and bear-baiting. In 1619 the company was joined
by Christopher Beeston, formerly of the Queen’s, and his house of the
Cockpit became available for their use.</p>

<p class="p-left">The company is first traceable in the country, at Bath during 1610–11
and at Ipswich on 28 May 1611. The names of Moore and Townsend render
possible its identification with an unnamed company, which on 29 August
1611 gave duplicate bonds of £500 to Henslowe for the observance of
certain articles of agreement of the same date. Unfortunately the
articles themselves are not preserved, but it is likely that they
contained an arrangement for the housing and financing of the company
by Henslowe.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> The signatories to both bonds include John Townsend,
Joseph Taylor, William Ecclestone, Thomas Hunt, John Rice, Robert
Hamlen, Joseph Moore, William Carpenter, Thomas Basse, and Alexander
Foster. To these one adds Giles Gary and William Barksted and the
other Francis Waymus. The names recited in the bodies of the documents
agree with the signatures, except that Gary appears in both. Several
of these men now come into London theatrical history for the first
time, but Gary is probably the Giles Cary who with Barksted played in
<i>Epicoene</i> for the Queen’s Revels in 1609, Taylor came from the
Duke of York’s, and Rice from the King’s. One Hunt, whose Christian
name is unknown, was with the Admiral’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> in 1601. Alexander Foster
received payment on behalf of the Lady Elizabeth’s men for three plays
given at Court during the Christmas of 1611–12. The first was on 19
January 1612 before Elizabeth and Henry; the second was <i>The Proud
Maid’s Tragedy</i>, on 25 February before James; and the third was on
11 March, again before Elizabeth and Henry. In 1611–12 the company
were at Dover and Coventry, and on 30 July 1612 at Leicester. On 20
October they played before Elizabeth and the Palsgrave, shortly after
the latter’s arrival in England, in the Cockpit. This was perhaps the
play paid for out of the private funds of Elizabeth, as the result of
a wager with Mr. Edward Sackville.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> During Christmas they played
twice before Charles, Elizabeth, and the Palsgrave, showing Marston’s
<i>The Dutch Courtesan</i> on 25 February and <i>Raymond Duke of
Lyons</i> on 1 March. For 1612–13 Joseph Taylor was payee.</p>

<p>The names of Taylor and Ecclestone are found in another document in
the Dulwich collection, which pretty clearly belongs to the Lady
Elizabeth’s men, and which shows that about the spring of 1613 their
business relations with Henslowe entered upon a somewhat troubled
phase. This is shown by internal evidence to have been written in the
course of 1615. It is here reproduced:<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="p-left">It is not quite possible to trace all the five breakings of companies
referred to in the closing sentence; but the statement is sufficient
to give a fairly clear outline of the history of the Lady Elizabeth’s
men during the years which it covers, and, as it happens, there is a
good deal of other evidence from which to supplement it. It appears
that in March 1613 Henslowe joined companies with Rosseter; that is
to say, that an amalgamation took place between the Lady Elizabeth’s
men and the Children of the Queen’s Revels, who had been acting at
the Whitefriars under the patent to Rosseter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span> and others of 4 January
1610. One of these children was Robert Baxter, if he is the Baxter
named in the Articles of Grievance as a fellow of the company with
Taylor between March 1613 and March 1614.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> During the same period
it appears that William Ecclestone left the company. He afterwards
joined the King’s men. But, before he went, he took a part in <i>The
Honest Man’s Fortune</i>, which is stated in the <i>Dyce MS.</i> to
have been played in 1613, while its ‘principal actors’ are named in the
1679 folio of Beaumont and Fletcher as ‘Nathan Field, Robert Benfield,
Emanuel Read, Joseph Taylor, Will. Eglestone and Thomas Basse’. This
particular combination seems to point clearly to the Lady Elizabeth’s
men as the original producers of the play. A very similar cast is
assigned in the same folio to <i>The Coxcomb</i>, namely, ‘Nathan
Field, Joseph Taylor, Giles Gary, Emanuel Read, Richard Allen, Hugh
Atawell, Robert Benfeild, and William Barcksted’; and I think that this
also must belong to a performance by the Lady Elizabeth’s men about
1613. <i>The Coxcomb</i> had certainly been played at Court by the
Queen’s Revels in 1612, but it seems impossible that Taylor can then
have been a member of that company.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> The new blood brought in from
Rosseter’s company will, then, have included Field, Attwell, Richard
Allen, Benfield, Reade, and perhaps Robert Baxter, of whom the first
three had played in Jonson’s <i>Epicoene</i> for the Revels in 1609.
When it is remembered that Cary and Barksted had been in the same cast,
it will be realized that the Lady Elizabeth’s men, as constituted in
1613, were very much the Queen’s Revels over again.</p>

<p>I think there can be no doubt that the Lady Elizabeth’s men was the
company principally referred to in the long series of letters from
Robert Daborne to Henslowe, which runs from 17 April 1613 to 31 July
1614.[688] Daborne had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> one of the patentees for the Queen’s
Revels in 1609, and some letters apparently belonging to the same
series show Field as interested, either as writer or actor, in some
of the plays which Henslowe was purchasing from Daborne, with a view
to reselling them to this company. Further confirmation is to be
obtained for this view from the signature of Hugh Attwell as witness
to one of Henslowe’s advances to Daborne,<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> and from the mention
of Benfield,<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> of Pallant who, as will be seen, joined the company
in 1614,<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> and of <i>Eastward Ho!</i> which their repertory had
inherited from that of the Queen’s Revels.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> That ‘Mr. Allin’
was hearing Daborne’s plays with Henslowe in May 1613 need cause no
difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> It is true that Edward Alleyn is not known to have
had any relations with the Lady Elizabeth’s men, but John Alleyn, a
nephew of Edward, is amongst Henslowe’s witnesses about this time,<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
and Richard Allen, who may not have belonged to the same family, was
himself one of the Lady Elizabeth’s men, and perhaps served as their
literary adviser. The correspondence makes it possible to recover
the names of a series of plays on which Daborne was engaged, either
alone or in collaboration with others, during the period over which it
extends, and all of which seem to have been primarily meant for the
Lady Elizabeth’s men, although he occasionally professes, as an aid to
his chaffering, to have an alternative market with the King’s men.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
From April to June 1613 he was writing a tragedy of <i>Machiavel
and the Devil</i>, and this is probably the ‘new play’, of which he
suggests the performance on Wednesday in August, to follow one of
<i>Eastward Ho!</i> on the Monday.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span> For this Henslowe covenanted
to pay him £20. In June he was also completing <i>The Arraignment of
London</i>, of which he had given an act to Cyril Tourneur to write;
and to this <i>The Bellman of London</i>, for which he and a colleague,
perhaps again Tourneur, asked no more than £12 and ‘the overplus of
the second day’ in August, was probably a sequel.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> This may be
the play which he had delivered to Henslowe about the beginning of
December. About July he seems also to have been occupied upon a play
in collaboration with Field, Fletcher, and Massinger. This is not
named, and Mr. Fleay’s identification of it with <i>The Honest Man’s
Fortune</i> is rather hazardous.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> In December he began <i>The
Owl</i>, for which his price fell to £10; and on 11 March 1614 he
had finished this, and was beginning <i>The She Saint</i> and asking
‘but 12<sup>l</sup> a play till they be playd.’ The correspondence has a gap
between the middle of August and the middle of October 1613. Probably
the company were on tour; they are found at Coventry, Shrewsbury, and
Marlborough in 1612–13, Canterbury on 4 July 1613, Dover between 12
July and 7 August, and Leicester on 13 October. In the spring they had
been at Bristol and Norwich. On 12 December they repeated one of their
plays of the preceding winter, Marston’s <i>The Dutch Courtesan</i>,
before Charles, and on 25 January 1614 gave <i>Eastward Ho!</i> which
they had been playing in public during the summer, before James. Taylor
was again their payee for this Christmas.</p>

<p>The statement of grievances indicates another reconstruction
of the company in March 1614. In this transaction, which apparently
involved the buying out of Rosseter’s interest, Meade was in
partnership with Henslowe, and Field was presumably in some position
of authority on behalf of the players, as it is alleged that Henslowe
bribed him, in order to obtain his assent to the modification of a
covenant under which he was to make an allowance for a withdrawal of
the theatre once a fortnight for baiting. The terms recited agree with
those of an undated and mutilated agreement between Henslowe and Jacob
Meade on one side and Field on behalf of an unnamed company of players
on the other. The text of this follows:<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">Mr. Fleay and Dr. Greg think that at the time of this reconstruction
the company was further strengthened by the incorporation of the Duke
of York’s, now the Prince’s, men.<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> This I doubt, as the Prince’s
men continued to play at Court, as a company quite distinct from the
Lady Elizabeth’s, during the winter of 1614–15. It is true that Robert
Dawes, who had been one of the Duke of York’s in 1610, joined the Lady
Elizabeth’s, but it was precisely one of the grievances that this man
and Robert Pallant were introduced by Henslowe, by means of a financial
adjustment unfavourable to the sharers, in June 1614. Pallant had
passed through several companies, and is traceable with Queen Anne’s
men in 1609. He was still technically a servant of the Queen at her
death in 1619.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> A letter from Daborne on 28 March 1614 shows that
he was then expecting an answer to some proposal made to Henslowe,
which the latter had neglected.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> Articles between Robert Dawes and

<p class="p-left">It must be mainly matter of conjecture at what theatres the Lady
Elizabeth’s had played from 1611 to 1614. Possibly they may have
begun at the Swan. Middleton’s <i>A Chaste Maid in Cheapside</i> was
published as ‘often acted at the Swan on the Bankeside by the Lady
Elizabeth her Seruants’, and although this publication was not until
1630, it is rather tempting to identify the play with <i>The Proud
Maid</i> of 1611–12. Probably the association of the company with
Henslowe led to a transfer to the Rose; and after the joining of forces
with Rosseter in March 1613, the Whitefriars must have been available
for the combination. That there were alternatives open in 1613 is shown
by two passages in Daborne’s letters.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> On 5 June he says that the
company were expecting Henslowe to conclude ‘about thear comming over
or goinge to Oxford’, and by ‘comming over’ may most naturally be
understood crossing the Thames. On 9 December he claims that a book he
is upon will ‘make as good a play for your publique howse as ever was
playd’, and the inference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> is that at the time Henslowe was interested
in a ‘private’ as well as in a ‘public’ house. Certainly the Watermen’s
complaint in the spring of 1614 indicates that there were then no plays
on Bankside, and both the Swan and the Rose must therefore have been
deserted. But by the autumn the Lady Elizabeth’s men were in the Clink,
occupying the newly built Hope on the site of the old Bear-garden; and
that the use of this theatre was contemplated in the agreements of the
previous spring is shown both by the presence of Meade, who is not
known to have been interested in any other house, as a party, and by
the reservation of one day in fourteen for the purpose of baiting.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
It was at the Hope that William Fennor failed to appear to try his
challenge with John Taylor on 7 October, and the Lady Elizabeth’s men
were presumably the players&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And such a company (I’ll boldly say)</div>
        <div>That better (nor the like) ne’er played a play&mdash;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">who came to the rescue and saved the occasion from fiasco. And it was
at the Hope and by the Lady Elizabeth’s men, as the Induction and the
title-page show, that Jonson’s <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> was produced on
31 October. There is a reference in the text of the play to Taylor’s
adventure,<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> and a compliment to Field, which puts him on a level
with Burbadge of the King’s men.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> was
presented on the very next day before James at Court. This performance,
for which Field was payee on 11 June, was the only one by the company
during the winter festivities of 1614–15. In February 1615 there was
a breach between Henslowe and the company, as a result of which the
Articles of Grievance were drawn up. According to the Articles Henslowe
‘brooke the companie’; but it is not quite clear what exactly took
place. In some form the Lady Elizabeth’s men certainly continued to
exist. They visited Nottingham in March 1615, and a letter from Lord
Coke to the Mayor of Coventry shows that they also contemplated a
visit to that town in the same month.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> My impression is that they
subsequently patched up another reconstruction with Henslowe, and that
on this occasion the process did entail some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> kind of amalgamation
with Prince Charles’s men. Field, however, probably now joined the
King’s men. The Lady Elizabeth’s do not appear to have been separately
represented when the Privy Council called the London companies before
them for a breach of Lent on 29 March 1615. It is true that they
may have been alone in not offending, but it is more probable that
William Rowley and John Newton, who were summoned, answered for the
amalgamation. The Prince’s men are recorded as playing at Court during
the Christmas of 1615–16 and the Lady Elizabeth’s men are not. Yet
the payee for their four plays, of which the dates are not specified,
was Alexander Foster, who had been a Lady Elizabeth’s man and not
a Prince’s man. But it is probable that both this amalgamation and
the earlier one between the Lady Elizabeth’s and the Queen’s Revels,
although effective as a business operation from Henslowe’s point of
view, did not amount to a complete merging of identities, such as would
entail a surrender of one or other of the official patents. Certainly
the Lady Elizabeth’s, the Prince’s and the Revels were in some sense
distinct, and yet in the closest relationship in 1615. So much is clear
from Rosseter’s patent of 3 June to build in the Blackfriars, which
contemplated that all three companies would share in the use of the new
house. That the joint user extended also to plays is suggested by the
title-page of Field’s <i>Amends for Ladies</i> (1618) which declares
it to have been ‘acted at the Blacke-Fryers, both by the Princes
Seruants and the Lady Elizabeths’. Perhaps this indicates alternative
rather than combined playing. Whatever the arrangement, it was probably
altered again on or before Henslowe’s death on 6 January 1616.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> A
company containing many of the former Lady Elizabeth’s men remained at
the Hope. But they went under Prince Charles’s patronage, and it is
not until 1622, when we find them at Christopher Beeston’s house of
the Cockpit or Phoenix, that we can be sure of the presence of Lady
Elizabeth’s men in London once more.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> But they had held together
in the provinces. Possibly the nucleus of the provincial company had
been formed of men left out by the Henslowe-Rosseter negotiations of
1613–14. They first appear at Norwich on 2 March 1614 under Nicholas
Long, who in 1612 had been travelling with Queen’s Revels boys. They
came again on 27 May 1615 with an exemplification of the 1611 patent
dated 31 May 1613, and again on 5 June 1616 under John Townsend, and
again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> on 7 June 1617 under Henry Sebeck. In the same year Joseph
Moore was acting as an agent of the Lord Chamberlain and Master of
the Revels in clearing the provinces of irregularly licensed players,
not improbably in the interests of the Lady Elizabeth’s themselves,
whose original patent was now set free, through changes in London, for
provincial use in place of a mere exemplification.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> The company
is also traceable at Leicester, Coventry, Nottingham, Marlborough,
and elsewhere from 1614,<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> and on 11 July 1617 Townsend and Moore
received a warrant for £30 in respect of three plays given before James
during his journey to Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> On 20 March 1618 Townsend and
Moore, with Alexander Foster and Francis Waymus, obtained a new licence
under the royal signet.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> This authorized them to play in London,
and their actual return there may have been earlier than 1622.</p>

INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES</h3></div>


<h5>i. ITALIAN PLAYERS IN ENGLAND</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The wanderings of the Italian
companies in Italy itself and in France are recounted in A.
D’Ancona, <i>Origini del Teatro Italiano</i> (ed. 2, 1891), and
A. Baschet, <i>Les Comédiens italiens à la Cour de France</i>
(1882), but without much knowledge of the few English records.
W. Smith, <i>Italian and Elizabethan Comedy</i> (<i>M. P.</i>
v. 555) and <i>The Commedia dell’ Arte</i> (1912), deals more
fully with these. The literary influence of Italian comedy is
discussed by L. L. Schücking, <i>Die stofflichen Beziehungen der
englischen Komödie zur italienischen bis Lilly</i> (1901), and
R. W. Bond, <i>Early Plays from the Italian</i> (1911).]</p>
</div>

<p>The England of Elizabeth and James was a lender rather than a borrower
of players. No records have been disinterred of French actors in this
country between 1495 and 1629;<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> and although there are a few of
Italian actors, their visits seem to have been confined to a single
brief period.<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> The head-quarters of Italian comedy during the
middle of the sixteenth century was at the Court of Mantua, and when
Lord Buckhurst went as ambassador to congratulate Charles IX of France
on his wedding, it was by Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers and brother
of the Duke of Mantua, that he was entertained on 4 March 1571 ‘with
a comedie of Italians that for the good mirth and handling thereof
deserved singular comendacion’.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> In the following year the Earl of
Lincoln was at Paris from 8 to 22 June in order to conclude a treaty,
and letters relate how he saw at the Louvre ‘an Italian playe, and
dyvers vauters and leapers of dyvers sortes verie excellent’, and how
later, when he visited the King at the Chateau de Madrid, ‘he had some
pastyme showed him by Italian players, which I was at with hym’.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>
It may perhaps have been encouragement from one or both of these
nobles, which led an Italian company not long afterwards to make its
way across the Channel. The first notice of it is at Nottingham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> in
September 1573, when a reward was ‘gevin to the Italyans for serteyne
pastymes that they shewed before Maister Meare and his brethren’.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
In 1574 the Revels Accounts include expenditure ‘for the Italyan
players that ffollowed the progresse and made pastyme fyrst at Wynsor
and afterwardes at Reading’. Elizabeth was at Windsor on 11 and 12
July; on 15 July she removed to Reading and remained there to 22 July.
At Windsor the Italians used ‘iij devells cotes and heades &amp; one olde
mannes fries cote’; at Reading, where they performed on 15 July, the
provisions included staves, hooks, and lambskins for shepherds, arrows
for nymphs, a scythe for Saturn, and ‘horstayles for the wylde mannes
garment’. Professor Feuillerat appears to suggest that they may have
been playing Tasso’s <i>Aminta</i>, produced at Ferrara on 31 July
1573. But there were other pastorals.<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> The Italians are probably
the comedians commended to the Lord Mayor on 22 July, and in November
Thomas Norton calls special attention to ‘the unchaste, shamelesse and
unnaturall tomblinge of the Italian weomen’. How long this company
remained in England is unknown. There was an Italian acrobat at the
Kenilworth festivities on 14 July 1575, but the description suggests
that he was a solitary performer.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> The Treasurer of the Chamber
paid ‘Alfruso Ferrabolle and the rest of the Italian players’ for
a play at Court on 27 February 1576, to the consideration of which
I shall return. In April 1577 there was an Italian play before the
Council at Durham Place.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Finally, on 13 January 1578, the Privy
Council addressed a letter to the Lord Mayor, requiring him to permit
‘one Drousiano, an Italian, a commediante and his companye’, to play
until the first week of the coming Lent. I take it that the company
was also at Court, since the Chamber Accounts for 1577–8 include an
item ‘for a mattres hoopes and boardes with tressells for the Italian
Tumblers’. The company to which the visit of 1573–4 was due cannot be
identified with any certainty. Presumably it came through France, and
ought to have left signs there. There seem to have been three Italian
companies in France during 1571. The first, in February, was that of
Giovanni Tabarin. The second, that seen by Lord Buckhurst in Paris,
was the famous Compagnia de’ Gelosi, of which one Signora Vittoria, of
Ferrara, known on the stage as Fioretta, was the prima donna. This,
however, had returned to Milan by the spring of 1572 and its subsequent
movements hardly render a visit to England in 1573 plausible. A third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
company, that of Alberto Ganassa, a Zanni or clown from Bergamo,
reached Paris in the autumn of 1571.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> It was sent away by the
Parlement on account of its high charges for admission, but returned
in 1572 and played at the wedding of Henri of Navarre and Marguerite
of Valois on 18 August. Nothing is heard of Ganassa in France after
October 1572, but during the summer of 1574 he seems to have been in
Madrid; so he also is not available for the English visit. It may
very likely have been his company which the Earl of Lincoln saw. But
it may also have been that led by Soldino of Florence and Anton Maria
of Venice, which was performing ‘commedies et saults’ before Charles
IX at Blois on 25 March 1572, and subsequently made its way to Paris.
My authorities say nothing further about Soldino and Anton Maria, so
we are at liberty to believe that Lincoln invited them to try their
fortune across the sea.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>The ‘Drousiano’ of 1578 offers less difficulty. He must have been
Drusiano, son of Francisco Martinelli, of Mantua, who in after
years won a considerable reputation, although less than that of his
brother Tristano Martinelli, as Arlecchino in the <i>commedia dell’
arte</i>.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> There is no other notice of him before 1580, when
he subscribes himself as ‘marito di M<sup>a</sup> Angelica’, who appears to
have been one Angelica Alberghini, and the company with which he was
associated in 1578 is not known.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> But it may very well have been
the Gelosi. This company paid in 1577 their second visit to France,
upon the invitation of Henri III, and remained there at least until
July. They seem to have been in Florence fairly early in 1578, but some
or all of them may have found time for an English trip in the interval.
Direct proof that Drusiano Martinelli ever belonged to the Gelosi is
lacking. But they are the only Italian company known to have been in
France in the summer of 1577, and players are not likely to have passed
from Italy to England without leaving some traces of their presence in
France.<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></p>

<p>The professional Italian actors of the second half of the sixteenth
century played both the popular <i>commedia dell’ arte</i> and the
literary <i>commedia erudita</i>, or <i>commedia sostenuta</i>. The
former, with its more or less improvised dialogue upon scenarii,
which revolved around the amorous and ridiculous adventures of the
<i>zanni</i>, the <i>arlecchino</i>, the <i>dottore</i>, and other
standing types, was probably best adapted to the methods of wandering
mimes in an alien land.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> The latter was common to professionals
and amateurs. And I suspect that the Court play of 27 February 1576,
although it earned its reward from the Treasurer of the Chamber, was
an amateur performance. The ‘Alfruso Ferrabolle’ of the account-book
can hardly be other than a clerical perversion of the name of Alfonso
Ferrabosco, the first of three generations of that name, father, son,
and grandson, who contributed in turn to the gaiety of the English
Court. The eldest Ferrabosco was certainly in this country by 1562
when he was granted an annuity of 100 marks. His service terminated
after various interruptions in 1578.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> He is doubtless the ‘Mr.

In connexion with the same mask, a reward was paid to one ‘Petrucio’,
while for a later mask of 11 January 1579 ‘Patruchius Ubaldinas’ was
employed to translate speeches into Italian and write them out fair
in tables.<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> This was Petruccio Ubaldini, another of Elizabeth’s
Italian pensioners, who was both a literary man and an illuminator,
and made his residence in England from 1562 to 1586.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> It is quite
possible that the performance of 1576 may be referred to in the
following undated letter from Ubaldini to the Queen, in which he makes
mention of Ferrabosco.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> If so, it came off after all.</p>

<h5>ii. ENGLISH PLAYERS IN SCOTLAND</h5>

<p>The interlude players of Henry VII, under John English, accompanied the
Princess Margaret to Scotland for her wedding with James IV in 1503,
and ‘did their devoir’ before the Court at Edinburgh.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> It is the
best part of a century before any similar adventure is recorded. In the
interval came the Scottish reformation, which was no friend to courtly
pageantry. Yet in Scotland, as elsewhere, Kirk discipline had to make
some compromise with the drama. In 1574 the General Assembly, while
utterly forbidding, not for the first time, ‘clerk playes, comedies or
tragedies maid of ye cannonicall Scriptures’, went on to ordain ‘an
article to be given in to sick as sitts upon ye policie yat for uther
playes comedies tragedies and utheris profaine playes, as are not maid
upon authentick pairtes of ye Scriptures, may be considerit before
they be exponit publictlie and yat they be not played uppon ye Sabboth
dayes’.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> It was once more a royal wedding that led to a histrionic
courtesy between England and Scotland. In the autumn of 1589 James VI
was expecting the arrival of his bride Anne of Denmark, a sensuous
and spectacle-loving lady, who had already had experience of English
actors at her father’s Court in 1586.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> And being then, two years
after his mother’s execution, actively engaged in promoting friendly
relations with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> Elizabeth, he sent a request through one Roger Ashton
to Lord Scrope, the Warden of the English West Marches, ‘for to have
her Majesties players for to repayer into Scotland to his grace’. In
reply Scrope wrote from Carlisle on 20 September to William Ashby, the
English ambassador at Edinburgh, begging him to notify the King, that
he had sent a servant to them, ‘wheir they were in the furthest parte
of Langkeshire, whervpon they made their returne heather to Carliell,
wher they are, and have stayed for the space of ten dayes’.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> After
all, the Lapland witches and their winds delayed Anne’s crossing for
some months, and James had himself to join her in Denmark. It is, I
think, only a conjecture that the players whose ‘book’ was submitted on
3 June 1589 for the licence of the Kirk Session at Perth, in accordance
with the order of 1574, were Englishmen.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> But certainly ‘Inglis
comedianis’ were in Scotland in 1594, probably for the baptism of Henry
Frederick on 30 August, and received from James the generous gift of
£333 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> out of ‘the composicioun of the escheit
of ye laird of Kilcrewch and his complices’.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> Probably Laurence
Fletcher was at the head of this expedition, for on 22 March 1595
George Nicolson, the English agent at Edinburgh, wrote to Robert Bowes,
treasurer of Berwick, that, ‘The King heard that Fletcher, the player,
was hanged, and told him and Roger Aston so, in merry words, not
believing it, saying very pleasantly that if it were true he would hang
them also’.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> In any case, Fletcher appears to have been the leader
of a company whose peregrinations in Scotland a few years later, much
favoured by James, were also much embarrassed by the critical relations
which then existed between the Sovereign and the Kirk. It is only a
conjecture that this was the company which was refused leave to play at
St. Andrews on 1 October 1598.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> But of greater troubles, which took
place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> at Edinburgh a year later, we are very well informed. They are
detailed from the Kirk point of view in the more or less contemporary
chronicle of David Calderwood.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>The King Chargeth the Kirk of Edinburgh to Rescind an Act.</i></p>

<p>Some English comedians came to this countrie in the moneth of
October. After they had acted sindrie comedeis in presence of
the King, they purchassed at last a warrant or precept to the
bailliffes of Edinburgh, to gett them an hous within the toun.
Upon Moonday, the 12<sup>th</sup> of November, they gave warning by
trumpets and drummes through the streets of Edinburgh, to all
that pleased, to come to the Blacke Friers’ Wynd to see the
acting of their comedeis. The ministers of Edinburgh, fearing
the profanitie that was to ensue, speciallie the profanatioun
of the Sabbath day, convocated the foure sessiouns of the Kirk.
An act was made by commoun consent, that none resort to these
profane comedeis, for eshewing offence of God, and of evill
exemple to others; and an ordinance was made, that everie
minister sould intimat this act in their owne severall pulpits.
They had indeid committed manie abusses, speciallie upon the
Sabboth, at night before. The King taketh the act in evill part,
as made purposelie to crosse his warrant, and caused summoun
the ministers and foure sessiouns, <i>super inquirendis</i>,
before the Secreit Counsell, They sent doun some in commissioun
to the King, and desired the mater might be tryed privatlie,
and offered, if they had offended, to repair the offence at
his owne sight; and alledged they had the warrant of the synod
presentlie sitting in the toun. The King would have the mater to
come in publict. When they went doun, none was called upon but
M<sup>r</sup>. Peter Hewat and Henrie Nisbit. After that they were heard,
the sentence was givin out against all the rest unheard, and
charge givin to the ministers and foure sessiouns to conveene,
within three houres after, to rescind their former ordinance,
and to the ministers, to intimat the contrarie of that which
they intimated before. They craved to be heard. Loath was the
King, yitt the counsell moved him to heare them. M<sup>r</sup>. Johne
Hall was appointed to be their mouth. ‘We are summouned, Sir,’
said M<sup>r</sup>. Johne, ‘and crave to understand to what end.’ ‘It is
true’, said the King, ‘yee are summouned, and I have decerned
alreadie.’ M<sup>r</sup>. Johne made no reply. M<sup>r</sup>. Robert Bruce said, ‘If
it might stand with your good pleasure, we would know wherefore
this hard sentence is past against us.’ ‘For contraveening of
my warrant,’ said the King. ‘We have fulfilled your warrant,’
said M<sup>r</sup>. Robert, ‘for your warrant craved no more but an hous
to them, which they have gottin.’ ‘To what end, I pray you,
sought I an hous,’ said the King, ‘but onlie that the people
might resort to their comedeis?’ ‘Your warrant beareth not that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>end,’ said M<sup>r</sup>. Robert, ‘and we have good reasoun to stay them
from their playes, even by your owne acts of parliament.’ The
King answered, ‘Yee are not the interpreters of my lawes.’ ‘And
farther, the warrant was intimated but to one or two,’ said
M<sup>r</sup>. Robert, and, therefore, desired the King to retreate the
sentence. The King would alter nothing. ‘At the least, then,’
said M<sup>r</sup>. Robert, ‘lett the paine strike upon us, and exeeme
our people.’ The King bade him make away. So, in departing,
M<sup>r</sup>. Robert turned, and said, ‘Sir, please you, nixt the regard
we ow to God, we had a reverent respect to your Maiestie’s
royall person, and person of your queene; for we heard that the
comedians, in their playes, checked your royall person with
secreit and indirect taunts and checkes; and there is not a man
of honour in England would give such fellowes so much as their
countenance’. So they departed.</p>

<p>They were charged, at two houres, by sound of trumpet, the day
following, at the publict Croce, about ten houres, to conveene
themselves, and rescind the acts, or ellis to passe to the horne
immediatly after. The foure sessiouns conveene in the East Kirk.
They asked the ministers’ advice. The ministers willed them
to advise with some advocats, seing the mater tuiched their
estate so neere. M<sup>r</sup>. William Oliphant and M<sup>r</sup>. Johne Schairp,
advocats, came to the foure sessiouns. The charge was read. The
advocats gave their counsell to rescind the act, by reasoun the
King’s charge did not allow slanderous and undecent comedeis;
and farther, shewed unto them, that the sessiouns could doe
nothing without their ministers, seing they were charged as
weill as the sessiouns, and the mater could not passe in voting,
but the moderator and they being present. They were called in,
and after reasouning they came to voting. M<sup>r</sup>. Robert Bruce
being first asked, answered ‘His Majestie is not minded to allow
anie slanderous or offensive comedeis; but so it is that their
comedeis are slanderous and offensive; therefore, the king,
in effect, ratifieth our act. The rest of the ministers voted
after the same maner. The elders, partlie for feare of their
estats, partlie upon informatioun of the advocats, voted to the
rescinding of the act. It was voted nixt, whether the ministers
sould intimat the rescinding of the act? The most part voted
they sould. The ministers assured them they would not. Henrie
Nisbit, Archibald Johnstoun, Alexander Lindsey, and some others,
tooke upon them to purchasse an exemptioun to the ministers.
They returned with this answere, that his Majestie was content
the mater sould be passed over lightlie, but he would have some
mentioun made of the annulling of the act. They refuse. Their
commissioners went the second tyme to the king, and returned
with this answere, ‘Lett them nather speeke good nor evill in
that mater, but leave it as dead.’ The ministers conveened apart
to consult. M<sup>r</sup>. Robert Bruce said it behoved them ather to
justifie the thing they had done, or ellis they could not goe to
a pulpit. Some others said the like. Others said, Leave it to
God, to doe as God would direct their hearts. So they dissolved.
M<sup>r</sup>. Robert, and others that were of his minde, justified it
the day following, in some small measure, and yitt were not
querrelled.</p>

<p>Several other documents confirm this narrative. The Privy Council
register contains an order of 8 November for an officer at arms to call
upon the sessions by proclamation to rescind their resolution and a
further proclamation of 10 November reciting the submission made by the
sessions.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> The Lord High Treasurer’s accounts contain payments to
Walter Forsyth, the officer employed, as well as gifts to ‘ye Inglis
comedianis’ of £43 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in October, of £40 in November
‘to by tymber for ye preparatioun of ane house to thair pastyme’, and
of a further £333 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in December.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> It is George
Nicolson, in a letter of 12 November forwarding the proclamation of
8 November to Sir Robert Cecil, who identifies the players for us as
‘Fletcher and Mertyn with their company’.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> The bounty of James,
although it must be borne in mind that the sums were reckoned in pounds
Scots, probably left them disinclined to quit Edinburgh in a hurry.
Another gift of £400 reached them through Roger Ashton in 1601;<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
and on 9 October in the same year they visited Aberdeen with a letter
of recommendation from the King, and with the style of his majesty’s
servants, and the town council gave them £22 and spent £3 on their
supper ‘that nicht thaye plaid to the towne’. Nay, more, another entry
in the burgh register tells us that the players came in the train of
‘Sir Francis Hospital of Haulszie, Knycht, Frenschman’, and one of
those ‘admittit burgesses’ with the foreign visitor was ‘Laurence
Fletcher, comediane to his Majesty’.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>Laurence Fletcher’s name stands first in the English patent of 1603
to the King’s men, and the inferences have been drawn that the
company at Aberdeen was the Chamberlain’s men, that their visit was
due to a proscription from London on account of their participation
in the Essex ‘innovation’, that Shakespeare was with them, and that
he picked up local colour, to the extent of ‘a blasted heath’ for
<i>Macbeth</i>.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> To this it may be briefly replied that, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Chamberlain’s men were at Court as usual in the winter of 1602, any
absence from London, which their unlucky performance of <i>Richard
II</i> may have rendered discreet, can only have been of short
duration; that the most plausible reading of the Scottish evidence is
that Fletcher’s company were in the service of James as Court comedians
from 1599 to 1601; and that there is nothing whatever to indicate
that Fletcher ever belonged to the Chamberlain’s company at all. In
fact, very little is known of him outside Scotland, although it is
just possible that he may have been the object of two advances made
by Henslowe to the Admiral’s men about October 1596, and described
respectively as ‘lent vnto Martyne to feache Fleatcher’ and ‘lent the
company to geue Fleatcher’.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> If Fletcher was the King’s man in
Scotland, it was not unnatural that he should retain that status when
James came to England; and it is very doubtful whether the insertion
of his name in the patent in any way entailed his being taken into
business relations with his ‘fellows’. I strongly suspect that his
companion at Edinburgh, Martin, was put into a precisely similar
position amongst Queen Anne’s men, for who can Martin be but Martin
Slater, who is often, as in the passage quoted above, called Martin
<i>tout court</i> in Henslowe’s <i>Diary</i>, and who certainly left
the Admiral’s men in 1597?</p>

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The earliest comprehensive study
of the foreign travels of English actors is that of A. Cohn,
<i>Shakespeare in Germany in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
Centuries</i> (1865). Much material has been collected, mostly
since Cohn wrote, in a number of local histories and special
studies, of which the most important are: C. M. Plümicke,
<i>Entwurf einer Theatergeschichte von Berlin</i> (1781);
D. C. von Rommel, <i>Geschichte von Hessen</i> (1820–38);

Kurfürsten von Sachsen</i> (1861); E. Mentzel, <i>Geschichte

<i>Zeitschrift für vaterländische Geschichte und Altertumskunde
Westfalens</i>, lvi (1898), 75 (Münster); G. Witkowzski in
<i>Euphorion</i>, xv. 441 (Leipzig). A collection of records
from the earlier of these and from more scattered sources is
in K. Goedeke, <i>Grundriss der deutschen Dichtung aus den
Quellen</i><sup>2</sup> (1886), ii. 524, and valuable summaries are given
in W. Creizenach, <i>Schauspiele der englischen Komödianten</i>
(1889), and E. Herz, <i>Englische Schauspieler und englisches
Schauspiel zur Zeit Shakespeares in Deutschland</i> (1903). The
excursus of F. G. Fleay in <i>Life and Work of Shakespeare</i>
(1886), 307, is misleading. Additional material, which has
become available since Herz wrote, is recorded by C. F. Meyer
in <i>Shakespeare-Jahrbuch</i>, xxxviii. 196 (Wolgast), and
C. Grabau in <i>Shakespeare-Jahrbuch</i>, xlv. 311 (Leipzig).
Useful special studies are by C. Harris, <i>The English
Comedians in Germany before the Thirty Years’ War: the Financial
Side</i> (<i>Publ. of Modern Language Association</i>, xxii.
446), A. Dessoff, <i>Über englische, italienische und spanische
Dramen in den Spielverzeichnissen deutscher Wandertruppen</i>
(1901, <i>Studien für vergleichende Litteraturgeschichte</i>,
i), and on the problem of staging (cf. ch. xx) C. H.
Kaulfuss-Diesch, <i>Die Inszenierung des deutschen Dramas an der
Wende des sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhunderts</i> (1905).
A collection of plays and jigs, in German, but belonging to
the repertory of an English company, appeared as <i>Engelische
Comedien und Tragedien</i> (1620); some of the plays have
been edited by J. Tittmann, <i>Die Schauspiele der englischen
Komödianten in Deutschland</i> (1880), and the jigs by J.
Bolte, <i>Die Singspiele der englischen Komödianten und ihrer
Nachfolger in Deutschland, Holland und Scandinavien</i> (1893).
German plays written under English influences are to be found
in J. Tittmann, <i>Die Schauspiele des Herzogs Heinrich Julius
von Braunschweig</i> (1880), and A. von Keller, <i>Jacob Ayrers
Dramen</i> (1865). Cohn prints, with translations, Ayrer’s
<i>Sidea</i> and <i>Phaenicia, Julio and Hyppolita</i> and
<i>Titus Andronicus</i> from the 1620 volume, and early German
versions of <i>Hamlet</i> (<i>Der bestrafte Brudermord</i>) and
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> from manuscripts. The literary records
and remains of the English players are fully discussed by
Creizenach and Herz, and their relation to Ayrer by W. Wodick,
<i>J. Ayrers Dramen in ihrem Verhältniss zur einheimischen
Literatur und zum Schauspiel der englischen Komödianten</i>
(1912).</p>

<p class="smaller">The material for the Netherlands, some of which was gathered
by Cohn, may be studied in J. A. Worp, <i>Geschiedenis van
het Drama en van het Tooneel in Nederland</i> (1904–8), who
also deals with the Dutch versions of English dramas. The
contemporary stage conditions in France are best treated by E.
Rigal, <i>Le Théâtre français avant la période classique</i>
(1901), and those in Spain by H. A. Rennert, <i>The Spanish
Stage in the Time of Lope de Vega</i> (1909), who uses the
results of recent researches by C. Pérez Pastor, which have
added much to the information furnished by C. Pellicer,
<i>Tratado histórico sobre el origen y progresos de la Comedia y
del Histrionismo en España</i> (1804).]</p>

<p>Thomas Heywood records, about 1608, that ‘the King of Denmarke,
father to him that now reigneth, entertained into his service a
company of English comedians, commended unto him by the honourable
the Earl of Leicester’.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> This King of Denmark was Frederick II
(1559–88), father of Christian IV (1588–1648), and of Queen Anne of
England. English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> ‘instrumentister’, Johann Krafftt, Johann Personn,
Johann Kirck or Kirckmann, and Thomas Bull, were at the Danish Court
as early as 1579–80, and in 1585 certain unnamed English played
(<i>lechte</i>) in the courtyard of the town-hall at Elsinore, when
the press of folk was such that the wall broke down. These may be
the same men who played and vaulted at Leipzig on 19 July 1585, and
are the earliest English players yet traced in Germany.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> But the
particular comedians referred to by Heywood were probably another
company who had accompanied Leicester to Holland, when he took the
command of the English forces in 1585, and had given a show, half
dramatic, half acrobatic, of <i>The Forces of Hercules</i> at Utrecht
on 23 April 1586. Certainly Leicester had in his train one Will, a
‘jesting plaier’, who is now usually identified with William Kempe,
and in August and September 1586 the Household Accounts of the Danish
Court record the presence of ‘Wilhelm Kempe instrumentist’, and of his
boy Daniell Jonns. It is not clear what were the precise relations
between Kempe and five other ‘instrumentister och springere’, Thomas
Stiwens, Jurgenn Brienn, Thomas Koning, Thomas Pape, and Robert Persj,
who were at Court from 17 June to 18 September 1586, and for whom the
same accounts record a payment to Thomas Stiuens of six thalers a
month apiece, at the end of that period. If he had, as is probable,
been their fellow up to that point, he did not accompany them in
their further peregrinations.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> These took them to the Court of
Frederick’s nephew, Christian I, Elector of Saxony (1586–91), as a
result of correspondence, still extant, between the sovereigns, in
which the offer of salaries at the annual rate of 100 thalers overcame
the reluctance of the Englishmen to face the perils of an unknown
tongue. They started with an interpreter on 25 September, and shortly
after their arrival at Waidenhain on 16 October received instructions
from Christian to follow him with mourning clothes to Berlin, where
he was then sojourning. Christian’s own capital was Dresden, and
here they held a formal appointment in his service, under which they
were bound to follow him in his travels, and to entertain him with
performances after his banquets, and with music and ‘Springkunst’, and
were entitled, beyond their pay, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> board, livery, and travelling
expenses, and a lodging allowance of forty thalers each. The Dresden
archives give their names as Tomas Konigk, Tomas Stephan or Stephans,
George Beyzandt, Tomas Papst, and Rupert Persten. Their departure from
Court is recorded on 17 July 1587.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> In all these notices music and
acrobatic feats are to the fore, but that the men were actors there can
be no doubt, for two of them, Thomas Pope and George Bryan, reappear
amongst Strange’s men, and thereafter as fellows of Shakespeare in the
Chamberlain’s company. Of Stevens, King, and Percy no more is known.
Kempe was abroad again, in Italy and Germany, during 1601, and returned
to England on 2 September. It is not certain whether he took a company
with him, or went as a solitary morris dancer. But it is noteworthy
that on the following 26 November an English company, under one Johann
Kemp, reached Münster, after a tour which had taken them to Amsterdam,
Cologne, Redberg, and Steinfurt. They played in English, and had a
clown who pattered in German between the acts.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>The man, however, who did most to acclimatize the English actors in
Germany was Robert Browne, who paid several visits to the country,
and spent considerable periods there between 1590 and 1620. With him
he took relays of actors, some of whom split off into independent
associations, and account for most, although not all, of the groups of
‘Engländer’ who became familiar figures at the Frankfort spring and
autumn fairs and even in out-of-the-way corners of northern Europe. Of
some of these groups the wanderings can be traced in outline, although
the frequent failure of the archives to record individual names is
responsible for many <i>lacunae</i>, which the conjectural ingenuity of
literary historians has done its best to fill. Many of these anonymous
performances I must pass over in silence.</p>

<p>Robert Browne first appears as one of Worcester’s men, with Edward
Alleyn, in 1583, and in 1589 these two, probably as Admiral’s men,
still held a common stock of apparel with John Alleyn and Richard
Jones.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> His career abroad begins with a visit to Leyden in October
1590.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> perhaps only tentative, for in February 1592 he
was preparing to cross the seas again, and to this end obtained for
himself, John Bradstreet, Thomas Sackville, and Richard Jones, the
following passport to the States-General of the Netherlands from the
Lord Admiral:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>


<p>Presumably the Lord Admiral gave this passport in his official
capacity, as responsible for the high seas, and it is not necessary to
infer that the travellers were in 1592 his servants.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>There are not many clear notices of Browne and his company during
this tour. They were at Arnhem, with a licence from Prince Maurice
of Orange-Nassau, in 1592.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Thereafter they may have gone into
residence at some Court, Wolfenbüttel or another. They can hardly have
been the English ‘comoedianten und springer’ who came to Nyköping in
Sweden for the wedding of Duke Karl of Sweden and Princess Christina of
Holstein on 28 August 1592<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>; for it was only two days later that
Browne approached the Frankfort magistrates for leave to play at the
autumn fair, where they gave <i>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</i> and some of
Marlowe’s plays.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> It was on this occasion that Fynes Moryson, the
traveller, visited the fair and noted the great vogue of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> English
actors amongst the merchants.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> Englishmen played at Cologne in
October and November 1592,<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> and at Nuremberg in August 1593;<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
but in view of the Nyköping company it can hardly be assumed that these
were Browne and his fellows, and indeed the leader at Nuremberg is
called ‘Ruberto Gruen’, which may, but on the other hand may not, be a
blunder for Browne’s name. The Cologne players are anonymous. At any
rate ‘Robert Braun, Thomas Sachsweil, Johan Bradenstreit und consorten’
were all at Frankfort in August 1593,<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> where they played scriptural
dramas, including <i>Abraham and Lot</i> and <i>The Destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrha</i>. Thereafter the company seems to have broken
up. Richard Jones certainly went home before 2 September 1594, when
he bought a gown ‘of pechecoler in grayne’ from Henslowe.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> He had
doubtless already joined the Admiral’s men.</p>

<p>Thomas Sackville and John Bradstreet probably went to Wolfenbüttel.
This was the capital of Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel
(1589–1613), himself the author of plays, mostly printed during 1593
and 1594, in which an English influence is perceptible. The Duke
married Elisabeth, daughter of Frederick II of Denmark, and his wedding
at Copenhagen in February 1590 was attended by his brother-in-law,
afterwards James I of England. It is possible that his earliest play,
<i>Susanna</i>, was written either for this occasion or for the
repetition of his wedding ceremony at Wolfenbüttel. In this piece
the jester, a conventional personage, bears the name ‘Johan Clant’,
in the later plays ‘Johan Bouset’; and in the <i>Ehebrecherin</i>
(1594) Bouset says, quite irrelevantly to his dramatic character, ‘Ich
bin ein Englisch Mann’. Both names are in fact of English origin,
from the words ‘clown’ and ‘posset’ respectively. Evidently the Duke
must in some way have been in touch with the English stage at a date
even earlier than Browne’s second German visit in 1592. It is not,
therefore, necessary to conjecture, as has been conjectured, that
Wolfenbüttel was the first objective of this visit.<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> Unfortunately
the Brunswick household accounts for 1590–1601 are missing, and
with them all direct evidence of the first formation of his English
company by the Duke has probably gone. The company existed by 1596,
when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> the ‘furstelige comoedianten och springers’ of the Duke paid a
month’s visit to Copenhagen for the coronation of his brother-in-law,
Christian IV of Denmark, on 29 August.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> In the following year we
find ‘Jan Bosett und seine Gesellen’ at Nuremberg, ‘Thomas Sackfeil
und Consorten’ at Augsburg in June, ‘Johann Busset’ and Jakob Behel
at Strassburg in July and August, and ‘Thomas Sackville, John Bouset
genannt’, Johann Breitenstrasse and Jacob Biel at the Frankfort autumn
fair.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> The identity of this company with the Wolfenbüttel court
comedians may perhaps be inferred from Sackville’s use of John Bouset
as a stage name, and from a reference, in this same year 1597, to
‘Thomas Sackefiel, princely servant at Wolfenbüttel’. Another member of
the company may have been Edward Wakefiel, with whom Sackville, also in
1597, had a brawl in a Brunswick tavern.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> No more is heard of them
until 1601, when John Bouset was expected to join his old friend Robert
Browne for the Frankfort Easter fair.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> The Brunswick household
accounts are extant for 1602 and 1608, and from 1614 onwards. Thomas
Sackville appears frequently. On 30 August 1602 he took a payment for
the English comedians. Later references to him from 1 October 1602 to
1617 are mainly in connexion with purchases for the ducal wardrobe. It
seems clear that, while remaining a ducal servant, and possibly even an
actor, he went into business and prospered therein.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> He is said to
have been selling silk at Frankfort in 1604, and in 1608 Thomas Coryat,
the Odcombian traveller and oddity, records:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The wealth that I sawe here was incredible. The goodliest
shew of ware that I sawe in all Franckford, saving that of the
Goldsmithes, was made by an Englishman one Thomas Sackfield a
Dorsetshire man, once a servant of my father, who went out of
England but in a meane estate, but after he had spent a few
yeares at the Duke of Brunswicks Court, hee so inriched himselfe
of late that his glittering shewe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> of ware in Franckford dit
farre excell all the Dutchmen, French, Italians, or whomsoever
else.’<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>
</div>

<p>John Bradstreet’s name appears in 1604 with that of Sackville in the
album of Johannes Cellarius of Nuremberg. He died in 1618 and Sackville
in 1628, leaving a library of theology and English literature.
Edward Wakefield reappears in the Brunswick accounts for 1602, not
specifically as a player. But certainly the playing company continued
to exist. The accounts mention it in 1608, and Thomas Heywood notes
its existence about the same date. There were English players at
Wolfenbüttel in May 1615 and at Brunswick in 1611 and 1617, but no
names are recorded, and it can hardly be assumed that these were the
original ducal company. Henry Julius himself died in 1613.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

<p>Robert Browne’s own movements are uncertain after the break-up of his
company in 1593. He is not traceable for a year or so either in Germany
or in England, where his wife and all her children and household died
of plague in Shoreditch about August 1593.<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> But sooner or later he
found his way to Cassel. This was another of the literary courts of
Germany, the capital of Maurice the Learned, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel
(1592–1627). Maurice himself wrote an ‘<i>Anglia</i> Comoedia’ and
other plays in Terentian Latin, which were performed by the pupils of
the <i>Collegium Mauritianum</i>, but are unfortunately not preserved.
He also composed music and, like the Duke of Brunswick, gave a welcome
to John Dowland on one of his several foreign tours.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> Possibly
Dowland was one of the two lutenists who are recorded to have spent
fifteen weeks at Cassel in 1594.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> In the following year there
were performances by players and acrobats at Maurice’s castle of
Wilhelmsburg at Schmalkalden, and in the same year Maurice wrote to
his agent at Prague to give assistance to his comedians in the event
of their visiting that city.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> To 1594 or 1595 may, therefore, be
plausibly ascribed undated warrants by which Robert Browne and Philip
Kiningsmann receive appointments from the Landgrave, undertaking to
do him service with their company in vocal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span> and instrumental music
and in plays to be supplied either by Maurice or by themselves, and
not to leave Cassel without his permission.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> Certainly Browne
was the Landgrave’s man by 16 April 1595, when a warrant was issued
allowing the export of a consignment of bows and arrows which he had
been sent over to bring from England to Cassel.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> The ‘fürstlich
hessische Diener und Comoetianten’ were at Nuremberg on 5 July 1596,
and a company under Philip Konigsman were at Strassburg in the
following August.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> Festivities were now in preparation at Cassel
for the christening of Maurice’s daughter, one of whose godmothers
was Queen Elizabeth, on 24 August 1596. Brown and one John Webster
were on duty at Cassel during the visit of the Earl of Lincoln, who
came from England to stand proxy for Elizabeth.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> Payments to the
English comedians and performances by them at Melsungen, Weissenstein,
and Rothenburg, in the Landgrave’s territory, are recorded in the
Cassel archives during 1597 and 1598. A proposed loan of them in 1597
to Landgrave Louis of Marburg seems to have fallen through, but in
1598 they left Cassel for the Court of the Palsgrave Frederic IV at
Heidelberg, with a liberal <i>Abfertigung</i> or vail of 300 thalers
and a travelling allowance of 20 thalers, which was entrusted to George
Webster.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> From Heidelberg they went to Frankfort towards the end
of 1599, but were refused leave to play, owing to the prevalence of
plague.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> Robert Browne, Robert Kingman, and Robert Ledbetter were
then of the company. Ledbetter must have recently joined them, as
he is in the cast of <i>Frederick and Basilea</i> as played by the
Admiral’s men in 1597. Frankfort having failed them, they fell back
upon Strassburg, and here they seem to have remained until the spring
of 1601.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Browne was their leader at their arrival, but he then
seems to have left them and returned to England, where he came to Court
as manager of the Earl of Derby’s men during the winters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> 1599–1600
and 1600–1.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> By Easter 1601, however, he had started on his fourth
tour, and appeared once more at Frankfort, possibly in Kyd’s <i>Spanish
Tragedy</i>. With him were Robert Kingmann and Robert Ledbetter, and
they were expecting to be joined by ‘Johannen Buscheten und noch andere
in unsere Companie gehörige Comödianten’. The old association of 1592
between Robert Browne and Thomas Sackville was, therefore, still in
some sense alive.<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Maurice of Hesse had not been wholly without English
actors, since Browne and his fellows left Cassel in 1598. It would
seem that George Webster returned from Heidelberg, or perhaps from
Strassburg, to his service. The ‘fürstlich-hessischen Komödianten und
Musikanten’ were at Frankfort in March, at Nuremberg in April 1600,
and at Frankfort again at Easter 1601. The names recorded are those of
George Webster, John Hill or Hüll, Richard Machin, and at Nuremberg
Bernhardt Sandt.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> Upon his second visit to Frankfort Webster would
have met his old leader, now become his rival, Robert Browne. The
Hessian company were for a third time at Frankfort in the autumn of
1601.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> In the following year they left the Landgrave’s service,
not altogether to the regret of some of his subjects, who resented a
patronage of foreign arts at the cost of their pockets.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Webster
and Machin, with whom was then one Ralph Reeve, were still using their
former master’s name when they visited Frankfort at Easter 1603.<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>
Thereafter they dropped it. Of Webster no more is heard. Machin is
conjectured to have joined for a short time an English company in the
service of Margrave Christian William, a younger son of the Elector
Joachim Frederick of Brandenburg, which came to Frankfort for the
Easter and autumn fairs of 1604.<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> The Margrave was administrator of
the diocese of Magdeburg, and kept his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> Court at Halle. His company is
traceable from 1604 to 1605, but I do not find any evidence of Machin’s
connexion with it. In May 1605 he appeared at Strassburg, and there
claimed as his credentials only his four years’ service with Maurice of
Hesse.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> Shortly before, he had been at the Frankfort Easter fair
with Reeve, and the two returned to Frankfort in the autumn, and again
at Easter 1606.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

<p>Robert Browne, for some years after the opening of his fourth tour
at Frankfort in the spring of 1601, does not appear to have attached
himself to any particular Court. He is found at Frankfort, with Robert
Jones, in September 1602, at Augsburg in the following November
and December, at Nuremberg in February 1603, and at Frankfort for
the Easter fair of the same year.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> With him were then, but it
would seem only temporarily, Thomas Blackwood and John Thare, late
of Worcester’s men, who had doubtless just come out from England,
when Elizabeth’s illness and death closed the London theatres.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
He is probably the ‘alte Komödiant’, whose identity seems to have
been thought sufficiently described by that term at Frankfort in the
autumn of 1604.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> He returned to Frankfort on 26 May 1606, and
was at Strassburg in the following June and July.<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Here he was
accompanied by John Green. On this or some other visit to Strassburg,
the company probably lost Robert Kingman, who, like Thomas Sackville,
found business more profitable than strolling. He became a freeman
of Strassburg in 1618, and in that year was able to befriend his old
‘fellow’ Browne, and in 1626 other actors on their visits to the
city.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> In the course of 1606 Browne seems to have entered the
service of Maurice of Hesse, who in the previous year had built a
permanent theatre, the <i>Ottonium</i>, at Cassel, and had now again an
English company for the first time since 1602. This is to be inferred
from an application for leave to play submitted to the Frankfort town
council on 26 August 1606, and signed by ‘Robert Braun’, ‘Johann Grün’,
and ‘Robert Ledbetter’ as ‘Fürstlich Hessische Comödianten’. Earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
in August the same men had been at Ulm.<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> They visited Nuremberg
with a letter of recommendation from their lord in November, and then
settled down at Cassel for the winter.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> But their service did not
last long. On 1 March 1607 a household officer wrote to the Landgrave
that the English found their salaries inadequate, and after performing
the comedy of <i>The King of England and Scotland</i> had declared,
either in jest or earnest, that it was their last play in Cassel.<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
Probably they were in earnest. Browne and Green went to Frankfort, for
the last time as the Hessian comedians, on 17 March.<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> Browne’s
name now disappears from German records for a decade. In 1610 he was a
member of the Queen’s Revels syndicate in London, and on 11 April 1612
he wrote a letter to Edward Alleyn from Clerkenwell.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> But whether
Browne left them or not, the company held together for a while longer.
Green was at Danzig and Elbing in the course of 1607.<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> Thereafter
it seems probable that he tried a bold flight, and penetrated to the
heart of Catholic Germany in Austria. In November 1607 an English
company was with the archducal court of Ferdinand and Maria Anna at
Gräz in Styria. A performance by them of <i>The King of England and
the Goldsmith’s Wife</i> is recorded.<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> They followed Ferdinand to
Passau, where they gave <i>The Prodigal Son</i> and <i>The Jew</i>,
and possibly also to the Reichstag held in January 1608 at Regensburg.
By 6 February they were back at Gräz, and a letter from Ferdinand’s
sister, the Archduchess Maria Magdalena, then just betrothed to the
Grand Duke Cosimo II of Florence, gives a lively account of their
performances and of the assistance which they rendered in the revels
danced at Court.<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> Their repertory included <i>The Prodigal Son</i>,
<i>A Proud Woman of Antwerp</i>, <i>Dr. Faustus</i>, <i>A Duke of
Florence and a Nobleman’s Daughter</i>, <i>Nobody and Somebody</i>,
<i>Fortunatus</i>, <i>The Jew</i>, <i>King Louis and King Frederick of
Hungary</i>, <i>A King of Cyprus and a Duke of Venice</i>, <i>Dives
and Lazarus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> It is not absolutely certain that the company
referred to in these notices was Green’s. No name is in fact mentioned.
But the probability suggested by the resemblance of the above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
play-list to those of 1620 and 1626, with which Green was certainly
connected, is confirmed by the existence of a German manuscript of
<i>Nobody and Somebody</i> with a dedication by Green to Ferdinand’s
brother the Archduke Maximilian, who was certainly present at the Gräz
performances, and by a letter which tells us that a company visiting
Austria in 1617 was the same as that which had played at Gräz in the
lifetime of the Archduchess Maria, who died in 1608. Unfortunately
the identification of this company of 1617 with Green’s is itself a
matter of high probability, rather than of absolute certainty.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>
The end of the visit to Gräz was marked by a duel in which one of the
English actors, ‘the man with long red hair, who always played a little
fiddle’, killed a Frenchman.<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> Green now, like Browne, drops for
some years out of the German records.</p>

<p>The Court functions at Cassel surrendered by Browne in 1607 were
resumed by his predecessors, in whose leadership Reeve had now
succeeded Machin; and the appearance of the Hessian company is recorded
at Frankfort during both the fairs of 1608 and 1609, the Easter fair of
1610, the autumn fair of 1612, and the Easter fair of 1613. A proposed
appearance for the coronation of the Emperor Mathias in June 1612
was prohibited, because the mourning for his predecessor Rudolph II
was not yet over.<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> It is perhaps something of an assumption that
the company was the same one throughout all these years. Reeve was
in charge up to the autumn of 1609; after that no individual name is
mentioned. The intervals between the fairs were presumably spent in the
main at Cassel. In the summer of 1609 the company visited Stuttgart and
Nuremberg and possibly other places, with a letter of recommendation
from their lord.<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> In the autumn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> of the same year John Sigismund,
Elector of Brandenburg (1608–19), who often entertained a company of
his own, but appears to have been temporarily without one, wrote to
Maurice to borrow them for the wedding of his brother at Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
In April 1610 they may not improbably, though there is no evidence of
the fact, have followed Maurice to the Diet at Prague.<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> In 1611
they are said to have been at Darmstadt.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> They certainly played at
the wedding of the Margrave Joachim Ernest, uncle of the Elector of
Brandenburg, at Anspach in October 1612, and later in the same month
paid a visit to Nuremberg.<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> No more is heard of them, or of any
other English actors in the service of Maurice of Hesse-Cassel, after
1613.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Reeve was a member of Rosseter’s syndicate for the building
of the Porter’s Hall theatre at Blackfriars in 1615, and with him were
associated Philip Kingman and Robert Jones, the last notices of whom in
Germany are as ‘fellows’ of Robert Browne in 1596 and 1602 respectively.</p>

<p>The appearance of Blackwood and Thare, late of Worcester’s men, in
company with Browne at the Frankfort Easter fair of 1603, has already
been noted. The only further record of either of them is of Thare
at Ulm and Augsburg in the following December.<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> But by a series
of conjectures, to which I hesitate to subscribe, they have been
identified with a company which came to Stuttgart in September 1603
in the train of Lord Spencer and Sir William Dethick, ambassadors
from England carrying the insignia of the Garter to Frederick Duke
of Württemberg, and there gave a play of <i>Susanna</i><a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>; with
a company which visited Nördlingen and other places in January 1604
under the leadership of one Eichelin, apparently a German, but with a
repertory which included a <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and a <i>Pyramus and
Thisbe</i><a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>; with a company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> which held letters of recommendation
from the Duke of Würtemberg at Nuremberg in February 1604;<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> and
with a company which took a repertory closely resembling the Nördlingen
one to Rothenburg in 1604 and 1606.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> This is all very ingenious
guesswork.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>All trace of John Green is lost for several years after 1608. An
isolated notice at Utrecht in November 1613 suggests that he may
have spent part of this interval in the Netherlands.<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> A year or
two later he returned to Germany. He was at Danzig in July 1615 and
again, with Robert Reinolds, late of Queen Anne’s men, in July 1616,
having paid an intermediate visit to Copenhagen.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> In 1617 he was
at Prague for the coronation of the Archduke Ferdinand as King of
Bohemia, and in July of the same year at Vienna.<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> The comparative
infrequency with which English actors visited Austrian territory
perhaps justifies the assumption that his is the company mentioned in
a letter of recommendation sent by Ferdinand’s brother, the Archduke
Charles, at Neiss to the Bishop of Olmütz on 18 March 1617, as having
played at Gräz before his mother the Archduchess Maria, who died in
1608, and having recently spent some months at the Court of Poland in
Warsaw.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> In 1618 Green’s old leader, the indefatigable veteran
Robert Browne, came out with a new company on his fifth and last visit
to the Continent. He is first noted at Nuremberg on 28 May.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> My
impression is that the two men joined forces. Green’s name does not
appear in the records for a couple of years. But Reinolds, who had been
with him at Danzig in 1616, was with Browne at Strassburg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> in June and
July 1618.<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> Later in the year Browne was at the autumn fair at
Frankfort.<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> There is no definite mention of him during the next
twelve months, but it is not improbable that the combined company was
that which visited Rostock in May and Danzig in July 1619.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> At any
rate Browne appeared at Cologne in October;<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> and then went for the
winter to Prague, where the Elector Palatine and the Lady Elizabeth of
England, now King and Queen of Bohemia, had set up their Court.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>
They were but a winter King and Queen. In 1620 the Thirty Years’ War
broke out, and Germany had other things to think of than English
mumming. Browne was at Nuremberg in February and at Frankfort for the
Easter fair.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> That is the last we hear of him. But Green reached
Cologne and Utrecht later in April, and was probably discreetly taking
the company home.<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> In 1626 he came out again with Robert Reinolds,
who made a reputation as a clown under the name of Pickleherring.<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>
The details of this later tour lie beyond the scope of the present
inquiry. Pickleherring is the clown-name also in a volume of
<i>Engelische Comedien und Tragedien</i>, printed in 1620, which
probably represents an attempt of Browne and Green to turn to profit
with the printers their repertory of 1618–20, now rendered useless by
their return to England.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> The plays contained in this volume, in
addition to two farces and five jigs, in most of which Pickleherring
appears, are <i>Esther and Haman</i>, <i>The Prodigal Son</i>,
<i>Fortunatus</i>, <i>A King’s Son of England and a King’s Daughter of
Scotland</i>, <i>Nobody and Somebody</i>, <i>Sidonia and Theagenes</i>,
<i>Julio and Hyppolita</i>, and <i>Titus Andronicus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> The first
five of these reappear in a list of plays forming the repertory of
Green at Dresden during the visit of 1626 referred to above. If the
titles can be trusted, two of the plays in this list had already been
played by Browne at Frankfort and Cassel in 1601 and 1607, three by an
unknown company, possibly that of Blackwood and Thare, at Nördlingen
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> Rothenburg in 1604 and 1606, and eight by Green himself at
Passau and Gräz in the winter of 1607–8.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> They number thirty in
all, as follows: <i>Christabella</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>
<i>Amphitryo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> <i>The Duke of Florence</i>,<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> <i>The

<i>Nobody and Somebody</i>,<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> <i>The Kings of Denmark and

and Verona</i>, <i>Old Proculus</i>, <i>Lear King of England</i>,
<i>The Godfather</i>, <i>The Prodigal Son</i>,<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> <i>The Count of
Angiers</i>, <i>The Rich Man</i>.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<p>The lists of 1620 and 1626 do not bear out Fleay’s assumption that the
repertories they represent were wholly made up of plays taken out by
Browne in 1592.<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span></p>

<p>Another member of Browne’s last expedition can perhaps be identified.
With him in 1592 had been Richard Jones, who afterwards became one
of the Admiral’s men in 1594 and left that company in 1602. He was
again associated with Browne in Rosseter’s Queen’s Revels syndicate of
1610. The following undated letter to Edward Alleyn is preserved at
Dulwich:<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>Endorsed</i>] Receved of master Allen the &emsp;&emsp; of
February the somme of &emsp;&emsp; [<i>and by Alleyn</i>] M<sup>r</sup>
Jones his letter wher on I lent hym 3<sup>l</sup>.</p>
</div>

<p>This has generally been dated 1592. But Alleyn’s first recorded
marriage was in October of that year, and the reference to Browne as
not going with the company has always been a puzzle. I suspect that
it was written in or near 1615, and that Jones was one of the actors
who started in advance of Browne under John Green. That he did travel
about this time is shown by two other letters to Alleyn about a lease
of the Leopard’s Head in Shoreditch held by his wife.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> The first,
from Jones himself, is not dated, but a mention of Henslowe shows that
it was written before the latter’s death on 6 January 1616, or at
least before Jones had heard of that event. The writer and his wife
were then out of England. The second, from Harris Jones, was written
from Danzig on 1 April 1620. Mrs. Jones was then expecting to join her
husband, who was with ‘the prince’, whoever this may have been. If
Jones had travelled with Browne’s men, he cut himself adrift from them
on their return, for in 1622 he entered as a musician the service of
Philip Julius,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> Duke of Wolgast in Pomerania (1592–1625), who had twice
visited England, and whose presence at more than one London theatre
is recorded in 1602.<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> Two petitions from Jones are in the Stettin
archives.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> On 30 August 1623 he asked permission, with his fellows
Johan Kostrassen and Robert Dulandt (Dowland?), to return from Wolgast
to England. Behind them they appear to have left Richard Farnaby, son
of the better-known composer Giles Farnaby.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> On 10 July 1624 Jones
wrote to the Duke that his hopes of profitable employment under the
Prince in England had been disappointed, and asked to be taken back
into his service.</p>

<p>All the groups of actors hitherto dealt with seem to have had their
origin, more or less directly, in the untiring initiative of Robert
Browne. There is, however, another tradition, almost as closely
associated with the houses of Brandenburg and Saxony, as the former
with those of Hesse-Cassel and Brunswick. Some give and take between
Cassel and the Courts of some of the Brandenburg princes has from time
to time been noted.<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> But Berlin, where the successive Electors of
Brandenburg, Joachim Frederick (1598–1608) and John Sigismund (1608–9),
had their capital, was during a long period of years the head-quarters
from which an Englishman, John Spencer, undertook extensive travels,
both in Protestant and in Catholic Germany. Of Spencer’s stage-career
in London, if he ever had one, nothing is known. Possibly he betook
himself to the Brandenburg Court during the English plague-year
of 1603. At any rate, comedians holding a recommendation given by
the Elector on 10 August 1604 and confirmed by the Stadtholder of
the Netherlands, Maurice Prince of Orange Nassau, in the following
December, were at Leyden in January and The Hague in May 1605.<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> It
is reasonable to identify them with the company under John Spencer, who
received a recommendation from the Electress Eleonora of Brandenburg to
the Elector Christian II of Saxony (1591–1611) in the same year.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>
At Dresden they possibly remained for some time, for although there are
several anonymous appearances, including the famous ones at Gräz in the
winter of 1607–8, which can be conjecturally assigned to them,<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>
they do not clearly emerge until April 1608, when a visit of the
Electoral players of Saxony is recorded at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> Cologne.<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> Subsequently
they waited upon Francis, Duke of Stettin and by him were recommended
to the new Elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund, who passed them on
once more to the Elector of Saxony on 14 July 1609.<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> Being in need
of comedians for his brother’s wedding in the same year, he applied,
as has been noted, for a loan of those of Maurice of Hesse.<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>
Dresden remained the head-quarters of Spencer’s men again during
the next two years, but in 1611 they were back in John Sigismund’s
service. Christian II of Saxony died in this year. In July and August
they visited Danzig and Königsberg, and in October and November they
attended the Elector to Ortelsburg and Königsberg for the ceremonies in
connexion with the acknowledgement of him as heir to his father-in-law,
Duke Albert Frederick of Prussia. On this occasion Spencer was at
the head of not less than nineteen actors and sixteen musicians, and
produced an elaborate Turkish ‘Triumph-comedy’.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> In April 1613
Spencer left Berlin on a tour which was to take him to Dresden once
more.<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> The company were at Nuremberg in June, still using the name
of the Elector of Brandenburg and playing <i>Philole and Mariana</i>,
<i>Celinde and Sedea</i>, <i>The Fall of Troy</i>, <i>The Fall of
Constantinople</i>, and <i>The Turk</i>.<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> In July and August
they were at Augsburg, and in September they returned to Nuremberg,
now describing themselves as the Elector of Saxony’s company.<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>
This Elector was John George I (1611–56), the third of his house to
entertain an English company. In October they played The <i>Fall of
Constantinople</i> at the Reichstag held by the Emperor Mathias at
Regensburg. Spencer was their leader, but they no longer claimed any
courtly status.<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> After an unsuccessful attempt to pay a third
visit for the year to Nuremberg, they went to Rothenburg, and so to
Heidelberg, whither the Elector Palatine Frederick V had just brought
his English bride. Here they spent the winter, and left to attend the
Frankfort fair of Easter 1614.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> In May their service with the
Elector of Brandenburg, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> now none of the most recent, helped
them to get a footing in Strassburg, where they stayed until July and
again played <i>The Fall of Constantinople</i>, as well as a play of
<i>Government</i>.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> In August they were at Augsburg and possibly
Ulm.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> In October they projected a return visit to Strassburg, but
were rejected, ‘so dies Jar hie lang genug super multorum opinionem
gewessen’.<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> Possibly they fell back upon Stuttgart.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> In
February 1615 they were in Cologne, and here a queer thing happened.
The whole company, with Spencer’s wife and children, was converted
to Catholicism by the eloquence of a Franciscan friar. The event is
recorded in the town archives and also in a manuscript Franciscan
chronicle preserved in the British Museum:<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Twentie fowre stage players arrive out of Ingland at Collen:
all Inglish except one Germanian and one Dutchman. All
Protestants. Betwixt those and father Francis Nugent disputation
was begunne and protracted for the space of 7 or eight dayes
consecutively; all of them meeting at one place together. The
chiefe among them was one N. Spencer, a proper sufficient
man. In fine, all and each of them beeing clearlie convinced,
they yielded to the truth; but felt themselves so drie and
roughharted that they knew not how to pass from the bewitching
Babylonian harlot to their true mother the Catholic church, that
always pure and virginal spouse of the lamb.’</p>
</div>

<p>It need hardly be said that in so Catholic a city as Cologne this
singular act of grace gave the performances of the English comedians an
extraordinary vogue. In June and July 1615 Spencer was at Strassburg,
in company with one Christopher Apileutter, who may have been the
Germanian or the Dutchman of the Cologne notice.<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> He attended the
autumn fair at Frankfort, using an imperial patent, perhaps given him
at Regensburg in 1613.<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> During the winter of 1615–16 he was again
in Cologne, still profiting by his conversion.<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> This, however, had
not made of him such a bigot, as to be unable to render acceptable
duty in the Protestant courts where his earliest successes had been
won. For a year his movements became obscure. But in August 1617 he
was playing before the Elector of Saxony and the Emperor Matthias
at Dresden.<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> And in the following year he once more entered the
Brandenburg service. During the interval which had elapsed since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
1613, John Sigismund had entertained another company. Early in 1614 he
engaged William, Abraham, and Jacob Pedel, Robert Arzschar, Behrendt
Holzhew, and August Pflugbeil.<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> The names hardly sound English; but
Jacob Pedel is probably the Jacob Behel or Biel who was travelling with
Sackville in 1597, William Pedel appeared as an English pantomimist at
Leyden in November 1608, and Arzschar, whose correct name was doubtless
Archer, is also described as an Englishman at Frankfort in the autumn
of 1608.<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> He was then in company with Heinrich Greum and Rudolph
Beart. A Burchart Bierdt appeared as ‘Englischer Musicant’ at Cologne
in December 1612.<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> Archer perhaps came from Nuremberg. He was at
Frankfort again in the autumn of 1610, and at the Reichstag held by
the Emperor Matthias at Regensburg in September 1613.<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> It must
have been this new company under Archer which visited Wolfenbüttel in
September 1614 and Danzig in 1615, styling themselves the Brandenburg
comedians.<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> The only names given at Danzig are Johann Friedrich
Virnius and Bartholomeus Freyerbott, and in fact the Pedels, Holzhew,
and Pflugbeil left Berlin at Easter 1615. Archer himself remained
with the Elector until May 1616. The field, then, was clear at Berlin
for the enterprise of Spencer. On 17 March 1618 John Sigismund made
a payment ‘to one Stockfisch’ for bringing the English comedians
from Elbing. Further payments to the English are recorded in the
following November, and in June 1619 for plays at Königsberg and
Balge in Prussia, of which the Elector had become Duke on the death
of his father-in-law Albert Frederick in the preceding August.<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>
In July 1619 the Elector of Brandenburg’s comedians are heard of at
Danzig.<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> On 23 December 1619 John Sigismund himself died, and
in 1620 Hans Stockfisch addressed an appeal for certain arrears of
salary to Count Adam von Schwartzenberg, an officer at the court of
the new Elector George William (1619–40), in which he claimed to have
enjoyed the Count’s protection for more than fifteen years. In reply
George William describes the petitioner as ‘den Englischen Junkher
Hans Stockfisch, wie er sich nennet’.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> There can be little doubt
that Hans Stockfisch was none other than John Spencer, for the period
of fifteen years precisely takes us back to his first appearance as a
Brandenburg comedian in 1605. His fish name corresponds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> to, and was
perhaps motived by, that of Pickleherring adopted by Robert Reinolds
of the chief rival English company about the same date. Both had their
prototype in Sackville’s John Bouset.<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> The Elector George William
was no friend to actors, and to Spencer, as to others, the Thirty
Years’ War closed many doors. In February 1623 he came to Nuremberg
with Sebastian Schadleutner, but was not allowed to play.<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> And that
is the last that is heard of him.</p>

<p>A few isolated records indicate the presence from time to time in
northern Europe of players not yet mentioned, and not obviously
connected either with the Browne or with the Spencer tradition. An
English company under Peter de Prun of Brussels visited Nuremberg in
April 1594. The name of the leader does not sound very English, and a
company, not improbably the same, is described as ‘niederländische’ at
Ulm in the following August. Heywood, however, speaks of an English
company as in the pay of the Cardinal and Archduke Albert, Governor of
the Spanish Netherlands, about 1608.<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> Maurice of Orange-Nassau,
Stadtholder of the Dutch Netherlands (1584–1625), who gave a
recommendation to Spencer in 1605, had also an English company of his
own, which visited Frankfort at Easter 1611, and then claimed to be
strange in Germany.<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> To Augsburg in June 1602 came Fabian Penton
and his company;<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> to Leyden in September 1604 John Woods and his
company,<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> and to Leipzig in April 1613 Hans Leberwurst with his
boys.<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> Of none of these is anything further known, nor of William
Alexander Blank, a Scottish dancer, who performed at Cologne in April
1605.<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>Traces of English players in southern Europe are few and far between.
That Kempe’s travels of 1601 took him to Italy has already been
noted.<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> There were some English acrobats at Madrid in January
1583.<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> On 25 May 1598 the Confrères de la Passion leased their
theatre in Paris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span> the Hôtel de Bourgogne, to ‘Jehan Sehais comédien
Anglois’, and on 4 June obtained judgement in the court of the
Châtelet, ‘tant pour raison du susdit bail que pour le droit d’un écu
par jour, jouant lesdits Anglais ailleurs qu’audit Hôtel’.<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> I do
not know whether I am justified in finding under the French disguise of
‘Jehan Sehais’ the name of one John Shaa or Shaw, conceivably related
to Robert Shaw of the Admiral’s men, who witnessed an advance by
Henslowe to Dekker on 24 November 1599.<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> In 1604 another English
company was in France, and gave a performance on 18 September in the
great hall at Fontainebleau, the effect of which upon the imagination
of the future Louis XIV, then a child of four, is minutely described in
the singular diary of his tutor and physician, Jean Héroard.<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Mené en la grande salle neuve ouïr une tragédie représentée par
des Anglois; il les écoute avec froideur, gravité et patience
jusques à ce qu’il fallut couper la tête à un des personnages.’</p>
</div>

<p>On 28 September, Louis was playing at being an actor, and on 29
September, says Héroard:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Il dit qu’il veut jouer la comédie; “Monsieur,” dis-je,
“comment direz-vous?” Il repond, “Tiph, toph,” en grossissant sa
voix. À six heures et demie, soupé; il va en sa chambre, se fait
habiller pour masquer, et dit: “Allons voir maman, nous sommes
des comédiens.”’</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, on 3 October:</p>

<p>
‘Il dit, “Habillons-nous en comédiens,” on lui met son tablier coiffé
sur la tête; il se prend à parler, disant: “Tiph, toph, milord” et
marchant à grands pas.’
</p>

<p>It has been suggested on rather inadequate grounds that the play
seen by Louis may have been <i>2 Henry IV</i>. Possibly the princely
imagination had merely been smitten by some comic rough and
tumble.<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> But it is also conceivable that the theme may have been
the execution of John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, at the restoration of
Henry VI in 1470.<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span></p>

<p>It would be rash to assume that these records of 1598 and 1604
represent all the visits of English actors to France during the
Elizabethan period; and it is not improbable that a search in the
municipal archives of Picardy and Normandy, as thorough as that which
has been carried out for Germany, might yield notable results. Some
general evidence that tours in France did take place can be cited.
John Green, dedicating his version of <i>Nobody and Somebody</i> to
the Archduke Maximilian about 1608, says that he had been in that
country.<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> His, indeed, so far as dates go, might have been the
company of 1604. And France, no less than Germany, is referred to as
scoured by the English comedians about 1613.<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;I include a few managers who
were not necessarily themselves actors. The earlier studies of
stage biography were mainly concerned with the Chamberlain’s
and King’s men in the list of ‘The Names of the Principall
Actors in all these Playes’, prefixed to the Shakespearian
F<sub>1</sub> of 1623. The statements about them in [J. Roberts]
<i>Answer to Mr. Pope’s Preface to Shakespeare</i> (1729) are
conjectural and not, as sometimes supposed, traditional. A
good deal was collected from wills and registers by E. Malone
(<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 182), G. Chalmers (ibid. iii. 464), and
J. P. Collier, <i>Memoirs of the Principal Actors in the Plays
of Shakespeare</i> (1846, <i>Sh. Soc.</i> revised edition in
<i>H. E. D. P.</i> iii. 255), and is summarized by K. Elze,
<i>William Shakespeare</i> (tr. 1888), 246. New ground was
broken by F. G. Fleay, <i>On the Actor Lists, 1578–1642</i>
(<i>R. Hist. Soc. Trans.</i> ix. 44), and in the list in
<i>Chronicle History of the London Stage</i> (1890), 370. Here
he criticizes Collier’s claim to have a list of 500 actors,
as he cannot find ‘that any list at all was found among his
papers’, and suggests that a forgery was planned. I am glad to
have an opportunity for once of defending Collier, even if it
is only against Fleay. The fifth report (1846) of the <i>Sh.
Soc.</i> shows that ‘a volume of the original actors in plays
by writers other than Shakespeare was in preparation, and
<i>Bodl. MS.</i> 29445 contains a number of rough extracts made
by Collier and P. Cunningham from London parochial registers,
with a digest of these and other material, entitled ‘Old Actors.
Collections for the Biography of, derived from Old Books &amp;
MSS. Alphabetically arranged’. I have used this manuscript
and cite it as ‘Bodl.’ or ‘B.’. The information is mainly
from the registers of St. Saviour’s, Southwark, St. Andrew’s
Wardrobe, St. Anne’s, Blackfriars, St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch,
St. Giles’, Cripplegate, and other churches. It appears to
be reliable, except perhaps in one or two points. One would,
of course, prefer to have the registers themselves in print,
but with the exception of those of St. James’s, Clerkenwell
(<i>Harl. Soc.</i>), and A. W. C. Hallen’s <i>Registers of St.
Botolph’s, Bishopsgate</i>, the published London Registers, as
shown by A. M. Burke, <i>Key to the Ancient Parish Registers
of England and Wales</i> (1908), are precisely those of least
theatrical interest. The Southwark registers in particular, and
the other records of that parish, including the ‘token-books’
or annual lists, street by street, of communicants, ought to
be made available. Some notes from them are in W. Rendle,
<i>Bankside</i> (1877, Harrison, Part ii). Southwark marriages
(1605–25) are in <i>Genealogist</i> (n. s. vi-ix). In these
records ‘man’ clearly means ‘player’. Extracts from other
registers may be found in parochial histories and elsewhere.
Some from St. Giles’s, Cripplegate, are in J. P. Malcolm,
<i>Londinium Redivivum</i> (1802–7), iii. 303, J. J. Baddeley,
<i>St. Giles, Cripplegate</i> (1888), and W. Hunter’s
<i>Addl. MS.</i> 24589. C. C. Stopes, <i>Burbage</i>, 139,
gives a full collection from St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch. An
interesting list of actors and their addresses <i>c.</i> 1623
is in C. W. Wallace, <i>Gervase Markham, Dramatist</i> (1910,
<i>Sh.-Jahrbuch</i>, xlvi. 345), cited as ‘J’. The citations ‘H’
and ‘H. P’ are from Greg’s editions of Henslowe’s <i>Diary</i>
and <i>Henslowe Papers</i>.]</p>

<p class="p-left">ADAMS, JOHN. Sussex’s, 1576; Queen’s, 1583, 1588. He possibly played
the clown Adam in <i>A Looking Glass</i> and Oberon in <i>James

join Hunsdon’s and play Adam in <i>A. Y. L.</i></p>

<p class="p-left">ALDERSON, WILLIAM. Chapel, 1509–13.</p>

<p class="p-left">ALLEYN, EDWARD, was born on 1 September 1566 in the parish of St.
Botolph, Bishopsgate.<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> His father was Edward Alleyn of Willen,
Bucks, Innholder and porter to the Queen, who died in 1570; his mother,
Margaret Townley, for whom he claimed a descent from the Townleys of
Lancashire which modern genealogists hesitate to credit, re-married
with one John Browne, a haberdasher, between whom and other Brownes
who appear in theatrical annals no connexion can be proved. Edward
Alleyn is said by Fuller in his <i>Worthies</i> to have been ‘bred a
stage player’. In formal deeds he is generally described as ‘yeoman’
or ‘gentleman’, and once, in 1595, as ‘musician’.<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> In January 1583
he was one of Worcester’s players; at some later date he joined the
Admiral’s men, and had as ‘fellow’ his brother John, with whom during
1589–91 he was associated in purchases of apparel. On 22 October
1592 he married Joan Woodward, step-daughter of Philip Henslowe,
with whom he appears ever after in the closest business relations. A
Dulwich tradition that he was already a widower probably rests on a
mention of ‘Mistris Allene’ in an undated letter about a German tour
by Richard Jones, which is commonly assigned to February 1592, but is
more probably of later date.<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> Alleyn is specifically described as
the Admiral’s servant in the Privy Council letter of assistance to
Strange’s men (q.v.), with whom he travelled during the plague of 1593.
Some of the letters passing between him and his wife and father-in-law
during this tour are preserved at Dulwich, and are full of interesting
domestic details about his white waistcoat and his orange tawny
woollen stockings, the pasturing of his horse, his spinach bed, and
the furnishing of his house.<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> His ‘tenants’ are mentioned and his
‘sister Phillipes &amp; her husband’. He had by this time a high reputation
as an actor, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span> witnessed by Nashe in his <i>Pierce Penilesse</i> of
1592, where he classes him with Tarlton, Knell, and Bentley, and says,
‘Not Roscius nor Aesope, those admyred tragedians that haue liued euer
since before Christ was borne, could euer performe more in action than
famous Ned Allen’; and in his <i>Strange Newes</i> of the same year,
where he says of Edmund Spenser that ‘his very name (as that of Ned
Allen on the common stage) was able to make an ill matter good’.<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>
An undated letter at Dulwich, written to him by an admirer who signs
himself W. P., offers a wager in which ‘Peele’s credit’ was also in
some way concerned, and in which Alleyn was to have the choice of any
one of Bentley’s or Knell’s plays, and promises that, even if he loses,
‘we must and will saie Ned Allen still’.<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> In 1594 <i>The Knack to
know a Knave</i> is ascribed, quite exceptionally, on its title-page,
not to the servants of a particular lord, but to ‘Ed. Allen and his
Companie’. From 1594 to 1597 Alleyn was one of the Admiral’s men (q.v.)
at the Rose. He then ‘leafte playnge’, but resumed at the request of
the Queen, although apparently without becoming a full sharer of the
company, when the Fortune (q.v.), which he had built for them, was
opened in the autumn of 1600. He became a servant of Prince Henry with
the rest of his fellows in 1604, and at the coronation procession on 15
March appeared as the Genius of the City and delivered a ‘gratulatory
speech’ to James ‘with excellent action and a well-tun’de, audible
voyce’.<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> Further testimonies to his talent are rendered by John
Weever;<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> by Ben Jonson, <i>Epigram</i> lxxxix (1616), who equals
him to Aesop and Roscius, and himself to Cicero, who praised them; by
Heywood, who says, ‘Among so many dead let me not forget one yet alive,
in his time the most worthy, famous Maister Edward Allen’;<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> and by
Fuller, who says, ‘He was the Roscius of our age, so acting to the life
that he made any part (especially a majestic one) to become him.’<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>
Of his parts are recorded Faustus,<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> Tamburlaine, Barabas in <i>The
Jew of Malta</i>,<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> and Cutlack in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> play of that name revived by
the Admiral’s men in 1594 and now lost,<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> while that of Orlando in
Greene’s <i>Orlando Furioso</i> is amongst the papers at Dulwich.<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>
Heywood, writing about 1608, speaks of Alleyn’s playing in the past.
He probably retired finally soon after the beginning of the new reign.
In 1605 he valued his ‘share of aparell’ at £100; but his name is not
in the patent to the Prince’s men of 30 April 1606, although as late
as 1611 he still retained his personal rank as servant to the prince.
It is difficult to give much credit to the legend that his withdrawal
was due to remorse, or, as one version has it, to an apparition of
the devil when he was playing Faustus.<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> Certainly he continued
to hold an interest in the Fortune, and conceivably in the Red Bull
(q.v.) also. And certainly remorse did not prevent him from continuing
to exercise the functions of Master of the Game of Paris Garden, a
post which he acquired jointly with Henslowe in 1604, having already
been interested in the Bear-garden itself since 1594. At this after it
became the Hope (q.v.) he was still about 1617 entertaining players.
But the time of his retirement synchronizes with the first beginnings
of his foundation of a school and hospital by the name of the College
of God’s Gift at Dulwich. By 1605 he was a wealthy man, with income
from substantial investments in leasehold property as well as the
profits from his enterprises, and on 25 October he took the first step
in the purchase of the manor of Dulwich, which was completed by 1614 at
a total cost of nearly £10,000. Here about 1613 he made his residence,
moving from Southwark, where he had been churchwarden of St. Saviour’s
in 1610. In 1613 also he began the building of the college, which was
opened in 1617. Alleyn himself acted as manager and was in a position
to spend upon the college and his own household some £1,700 a year. The
endowment of the college included, besides house property in London,
the freehold of the Fortune. Henslowe had died in January 1616 and
his widow in the following year, and his papers passed to Alleyn and
remain at Dulwich. Here, too, is Alleyn’s own diary for 1617–22, and
this and his correspondence show him as a friend of persons of honour,
and the patron of writers and the members of his own former profession.
Alleyn’s wife Joan died on 28 June 1623 and on the following 3 December
he married Constance, daughter of John Donne, dean of St. Paul’s,
settling on her £1,500. A letter of 23 July 1624 indicates that he
was then desirous of obtaining ‘sum further dignetie’. He died on 25
November 1626.</p>

<p class="p-left">ALLEYN, JOHN. Admiral’s, 1589–91. Edward Alleyn had an elder brother
John, who was born in 1556–7, and is described as servant to Lord
Sheffield and an Innholder in 1580, and as servant to the Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
Admiral in 1589. He died about May 1596, being then of St. Andrew’s,
Holborn, and left a widow Margaret and son John. Presumably he was the
Admiral’s player. But there was also an Allen family of St. Botolph’s,
Bishopsgate, one of whom, John, was a player. Here a John was baptized
on 17 October 1570, a Lowin, son of John, baptized on 15 December 1588,
a Joan buried on 13 May 1593, and a John on 18 May 1593. On 26 July
1596 is this curious baptismal entry: ‘Bennett, reputed daughter of
J<sup>no</sup> Allen, which J<sup>no</sup> went with S<sup>r</sup> Fr. Drake to the Indians in
which time the child was got by a stage-player.’ Finally, on 18 October
1597, ‘Jone uxor Joh<sup>is</sup> Allen player was buried with a still born
child’ (H. ii. 239; Bodl.)</p>

<p class="p-left">ALLEYN, RICHARD. Queen’s, (?) 1594; Admiral’s, 1597–1600. His daughters
Anna and Elizabeth were baptized at St. Saviour’s, Southwark, on 13
May 1599 and 17 May 1601 respectively. Here he is traceable in the
token-books during 1583–1601, and was buried on 18 November 1601,
leaving a widow (Rendle, <i>Bankside</i>, xxvi; H. ii. 239; Bodl.).</p>

<p class="p-left">ARCHER? (ARZSCHAR, ERTZER), ROBERT. Germany, 1608–16.</p>

<p class="p-left">ARKINSTALL, JOHN. A common player of interludes under licence, with
Richard Archer, Barker, and Anthony Ward as his fellows. He was at
Hastings on 25 March 1603, and on 30 March laid an information of the
proclamation of Lord Beauchamp as king by Lord Southampton (<i>Hist.
MSS.</i> xii. 4. 126).</p>

<p class="p-left">ARMIN, ROBERT, is said to have been apprentice to a goldsmith in
Lombard Street, and to have been encouraged as a ‘wag’ by Tarlton
(<i>ob.</i> 1588), who prophesied that he should ‘enjoy my clownes sute
after me’. He ‘used to’ Tarlton’s plays, and in time became himself
a player ‘and at this houre performes the same, where, at the Globe
on the Banks side men may see him’.<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> But his earliest reputation
was as a writer. He wrote a preface to <i>A Brief Resolution of the
Right Religion</i> (1590) and probably other things now unknown, for
he is referred to as a son of Elderton in Nashe’s <i>Foure Letters
Confuted</i> of 1592 (<i>Works</i>, i. 280). R. A. wrote verses to
Robert Tofte’s <i>Alba</i> (1598), and R. A. compiled <i>England’s
Parnassus</i> (1600); the latter is generally taken to be Robert
Allot. The first dramatic company in which Armin can be traced is Lord
Chandos’s men. In an epistle to Mary, widow of William Lord Chandos
(1594–1602) prefixed to his kinsman Gilbert Dugdale’s <i>True Discourse
of the Practises of Elizabeth Caldwell</i>, &amp;c. (1604), he says, ‘Your
good honor knowes Pinck’s poor heart, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span> in all my services to your
late deceased kind lord, never savoured of flatterie or fixion.’ In
his <i>Foole upon Foole, or Six Sortes of Sottes</i> (1600) he tells
an incident which took place at Pershore in Worcestershire, during a
tour of ‘the Lord Shandoyes players’, at which he was himself present,
not improbably playing the clown ‘Grumball’.<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> By 1599, however, he
had probably joined the Chamberlain’s men, for in the first edition
of <i>Foole upon Foole</i> he describes himself as ‘Clonnico de
Curtanio Snuffe’. In a later edition of 1605 this becomes ‘Clonnico
del Mondo Snuffe’. Both issues are anonymous, but Armin put his name
to an enlargement entitled <i>A Nest of Ninnies</i> (1608).<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>
‘Clunnyco de Curtanio Snuffe’ is also on the title-page of <i>Quips
upon Questions</i> (1600), which must therefore be by Armin and not by
J. Singer, whose autograph Collier (<i>Bibl. Cat.</i> ii. 203) said
that he found on a copy. This is a book of quatrains on stage ‘themes’
(cf. ch. xviii). It was written, as a reference to 28 December as on a
Friday shows, in 1599. The author serves a master at Hackney (A ij).
Later editions of 1601 and 1602 are said to have been in the Harley
collection, and there is a reprint by F. Ouvry (1875). His name is
in the 1603 licence for the King’s men and in the Coronation list of
1604. In 1605 Augustine Phillips left him 20<i>s.</i> as his ‘fellow’.
Collier’s statement that in the same year he and Kempe (q.v.) were
in trouble for libelling aldermen cannot be verified. He is a King’s
man on the title-page of his <i>Two Maids of Moreclacke</i> (1609),
produced by the King’s Revels, and on the title-page and in the S. R.
entry on 6 February 1609 of his <i>Phantasma, the Italian Tailor and
his Boy</i>. This is a translation from Straparola and is dedicated
to Lord and Lady Haddington. In it he claims to have been ‘writ down
an ass in his time’ and refers to ‘his constableship’, from which it
is inferred that he played Dogberry in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>.
Fleay, <i>L. of S.</i> 300, finds a pun on ‘armine’ (= wretch) in
<i>London Prodigal</i> (<i>c.</i> 1603), v. i. 179, and suggests that
Armin played Matthew Flowerdale. There is a clown Robin in <i>Miseries
of Enforced Marriage</i> (1607), and a clown Grumball in <i>If it be
not Good</i> (1610–12), but this was a play of Anne’s men. He is in the
actor-list of Jonson’s <i>Alchemist</i> (1610). An epigram on ‘honest
gamesome Robert Armin’ is in John Davies of Hereford’s <i>Scourge
of Folly</i> (S.R. 8 October 1610). He is not in the actor-list of
Jonson’s <i>Catiline</i> (1611), nor has any later notice of him been
found. That Armin is the R. A. whose play <i>The Valiant Welshman</i>
was published in 1615 is only a conjecture. He is in the Folio list of
actors in Shakespeare’s plays. It is possible that a woodcut on the
title-page of the <i>Two Maids</i> (q.v.) gives his portrait.</p>

<i>Hiren</i> (1611), which has sonnets to Henry Earl of Oxford, and
Elizabeth Countess of Derby. On the title-page he describes himself as
‘one of the servants of his Maiesties Revels’. The surmise of Fleay,
i. 29, that this was repeated from an earlier edition of <i>c.</i>
1607 now lost may receive some confirmation from the connexion of
Machin with the King’s Revels; but it must also be remembered that the
Whitefriars Revels’ company appears to be occasionally described as
the King’s Revels in provincial records of <i>c.</i> 1611. A trivial
anecdote of him is in J. Taylor, <i>Wit and Mirth</i> (1629).</p>

<p class="p-left">BEESTON, CHRISTOPHER, has been conjectured to be the ‘Kit’ who played
a Lord and a Captain in <i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i> for Strange’s or
the Admiral’s about 1590–1. The actor-list of <i>Every Man in his
Humour</i> shows that he belonged to the Chamberlain’s men in 1598. He
is not, however, named as a performer of Shakespeare’s plays in the
Folio of 1623. Probably he was at one time the hired man of Augustine
Phillips who left him 30<i>s.</i> as his ‘servant’ in 1605. By 1602 he
had passed to Worcester’s men, and with this company, afterwards Queen
Anne’s, he remained until it was reconstituted on the Queen’s death in
1619, taking a prominent part in the management of the company, after
the death of Thomas Greene in 1612. He seems to have built or acquired
the Cockpit theatre, and to have successively housed there Queen
Anne’s men (1617–19), Prince Charles’s men (1619–22), Lady Elizabeth’s
men (1622–5), Queen Henrietta’s men (1625–37), and ‘the King’s and
Queen’s young company’, also known as ‘Beeston’s boys’ (1637). By
1639 he had been succeeded as ‘Governor’ of this company by his son
William Beeston, and was doubtless dead. The Cockpit had passed by June
1639 to ‘Mrs. Elizabeth Beeston, alias Hutcheson’.<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> It appears
from the lawsuit of 1623, in which Queen Anne’s men were concerned,
that Christopher Beeston also bore the <i>alias</i> of Hutcheson or
Hutchinson. But if Elizabeth was his widow, she must have been a second
wife, for the records of the Middlesex justices for 1615–17 record
several true bills for recusancy as brought against a wife Jane. In
these records Beeston, whose <i>alias</i> is also given, is described
as a gentleman or yeoman, and as ‘late of St. James-at-Clerkenwell’, or
in one case ‘of Turmil streete’. In 1617 his house was burgled by Henry
Baldwin and others.<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> The registers of St. James’s, Clerkenwell,
record the baptism of a daughter Anne on 15 September 1611, and the
burial of a servant on 1 July 1615.<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> But at an earlier date
Beeston lived in St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, where his sons Augustine,
Christopher, and Robert were baptized, and the first two buried between
16 November 1604 and 15 July 1610. Robert also was buried there on 26
December 1615, but Christopher was then described in the register as of
Clerkenwell. Possibly he afterwards returned to Shoreditch, as Collier
states that his name is traceable in the register up to 1637.<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>
His son William, also a suspected recusant, was living in Bishopsgate
Without just before his death in 1682.<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> An earlier William Beeston,
with whom Christopher may have had some connexion, is the ‘Maister Apis
Lapis’ and ‘Gentle M. William’, to whom Nashe addressed his <i>Strange
Newes</i> (1592).<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">BURBADGE, JAMES. The Shakespearo-centric tendencies of literary
historians have led them to suggest a regional connexion between the
dramatist and the family of his most famous interpreter.<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> There
was a Warwickshire family of Burbadge, of whom John was bailiff of
Stratford-on-Avon in 1555, and Malone was thus led (<i>Var.</i> iii.
187) to ‘suspect’ that James Burbadge was Shakespeare’s countryman.
Collier (iii. 258) having learnt that the arms claimed by Cuthbert
Burbadge at the London visitation of 1634, ‘crest, a boar’s head;
and three boars’ heads on a shield’ (<i>Harleian Soc.</i> xv), were
those of a Hertfordshire family, attempted the explanation that
the two families ‘were in some way related’. He committed himself
deeply by publishing in 1835 (<i>New Facts</i>, 32; cf. Ingleby,
256) a forged letter from H. S. to Sir Thomas Egerton, containing
the statement that Shakespeare and Richard Burbadge are ‘both of one
countie, and indeede almost of one towne’. Burbadges are traceable in
various parts of England, including Somerset, Oxfordshire, and Durham
(Halliwell-Phillipps, ii. 344; Stopes, 134, 243), and the conjecture
has about as much value as Malone’s derivation of the name (<i>Var.</i>
iii. 182) from ‘Borough-bridge’, or Chalmers’s from ‘Boar’s badge’.
Nor is any connexion known between James Burbadge and various other
Burbadges&mdash;Robert, John, and Edward&mdash;who appear in contemporary
documents (Collier, iii. 282; Stopes, 152), although A. Wood (<i>Fasti
Oxon.</i> i. 303) makes himself responsible for the statement that one
John Burbadge, of Lincoln College, was nearly related to the actor.
The name is indifferently spelt Burbadge, Burbage, or Burbege by
contemporaries, but usually Burbadge in family signatures (Wallace, 61,
63 ‘James Burbage’, 252; Collier, iii. 294; <i>Malone Soc. Coll.</i>
ii. 69, 76). James sealed the Blackfriars indentures of 1596 with a
griffin.</p>

<p>James was about sixty on 16 February 1591 (Wallace, 61) and was
therefore born in 1530–1. He was ‘by occupacion a joyner and reaping
but a small lyving by the same, gave it over and became a commen player
in playes’ (Wallace, 141). He was one of Leicester’s men in 1572, 1574,
and 1576, and apparently continued a ‘fellow’ of this or some other
company for a year or two after he established the Theatre in 1576
(Wallace, 142). In this year he was a poor man, and of small credit,
not worth above 100 marks (Wallace, 134, 141, 153), but he had enlisted
the capital of John Brayne, whose sister Ellen he had married (Wallace,
40, 139). His business history thereafter is bound up with that of the
Theatre (q.v.) and of the Blackfriars, which he planned, but probably
never used, during the last years of his life. Cuthbert Burbadge says
of him (<i>Blackfriars Sharers Papers</i>, 1635)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> that he ‘was the
first builder of playhowses, and was himselfe in his younger yeeres
a player’. He was described as ‘joyner’ in the lease of the Theatre
site in 1576, but in later years usually as ‘yeoman’ or ‘gentleman’.
Presumably he went to live in Shoreditch in 1576, as entries for his
family then begin in the registers of St. Leonard’s (Stopes, 139). They
testify to the baptism (17 March 1576) of a daughter Alice, mentioned
as Alice Walker in the will of Nicholas Tooley (q.v.) in 1623, and
the burial (18 August 1582) of a daughter Joan. Another daughter,
Helen, was buried at St. Anne’s, Blackfriars, on 15 December 1595
(<i>Bodl.</i>). Besides Alice and Helen he had in 1588 (Wallace, 39)
two sons, Cuthbert and Richard, who would both have been born before
1576. James himself was buried at Shoreditch on 2 February 1597 and his
widow on 8 May 1613. The registers generally give the family residence
as ‘Halliwell Street’, and the ‘Halliwell’ which appears in 1597 and
1601 is perhaps an accidental variant. But the lawsuits suggest that
James had built himself a house in the old inner cloister yard of the
priory, which lay a little north of Halliwell Street, if that is the
same as Holywell Lane (Wallace, 232, 236). They also represent him as a
man of violent temper and not over-honest, while an independent record
(App. D, No. lxxiv) refers to him as ‘a stubburne fellow’. Before his
death he seems to have made over his interest in the Blackfriars to his
son Richard, while that in the Theatre had passed by redemption of a
mortgage to Cuthbert (Wallace, 55, 73, 108, 145, 278).</p>

<p>Cuthbert Burbadge, the elder son of James, was not an actor, although
as holder of the leases of the Theatre and afterwards of the Globe
(q.v.) he was concerned during the greater part of his life with
theatrical management. On 16 February 1591 he was servant to Walter
Cope, gentleman usher to Lord Burghley. He was then twenty-four, and
must have been born in 1566–7. He was then probably living in the
Strand (Stopes, 152), but the subsidy rolls for 1597 (Stopes, 195) show
him as assessed at 10<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in Holywell Street, and the
registers of St. Leonard’s have the records of his children, Walter
(bapt. 22 June 1595), James (bur. 15 July 1597), and Elizabeth (bapt.
30 December 1601). Of these only Elizabeth, the wife first of Amias
Maxey and secondly of George Bingley, was alive in 1634 and her son
Amias had been adopted by his grandfather. Cuthbert himself was buried
at Shoreditch on 17 September 1636, and his widow Elizabeth, daughter
of John Cox, on 1 October 1636 (Stopes, 134, 140). His friendship with
members of the King’s company is commemorated by notices in the wills
of William Sly (1608), Richard Cowley (1618), and Nicholas Tooley,
who died in his house in 1623. Collier (iii. 285) identified him with
Cuthbert Burby the stationer, but Burby was in fact the son of Edmund
Burby of Beds., husbandman (Arber, ii. 127). Possibly, however, the
families were related, since Burby’s name is given at least once in the
Stationers’ Register (Arber, ii. 612) as ‘Burbidge’.</p>

<p class="p-left">BURBADGE, RICHARD, makes his first appearance, picturesquely enough,
in the brawl at the Theatre which followed upon the Chancery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> Order
of 13 November 1590, restoring a moiety of the profits of the house
to the widow Brayne (cf. p. 392). John Alleyn deposed (Wallace, 101)
that he ‘found the foresaid Ry. Burbage the yongest sone of the said
James Burbage there, w<sup>t</sup> a broome staff in his hand, of whom when
this deponente asked what sturre was there, he answered in laughing
phrase hew they come for a moytie. But quod he (holding vppe the said
broomes staff) I haue, I think, deliuered him a moytie with this &amp;
sent them packing.’ Nicholas Bishop (Wallace, 98, 115), one of Mrs.
Brayne’s agents, adds the confirmatory detail that ‘the said Ry.
Burbage scornfully &amp; disdainfullye playing with this deponentes nose,
sayd, that yf he delt in the matter, he wold beate him also, and did
chalendge the field of him at that tyme’. Very possibly Richard was
then playing with the Admiral’s men at the Theatre. His exact age
is unknown, but he was younger than Cuthbert, born in 1566–7, and
as Cuthbert, long after, spoke of the ‘35 yeeres paines, cost, and
labour’ out of which his brother ‘made meanes to leave his wife and
children some estate’ in 1619 (<i>Sharers Papers</i>), it may perhaps
be inferred that his histrionic career began as early as 1584. The
‘plot’ of <i>The Dead Man’s Fortune</i>, wherein the doubtful direction
(cf. p. 125) ‘Burbage a messenger’ suggests that he played a minor
part, may belong to a performance by the Admiral’s <i>c.</i> 1590.
It is a little more difficult to suppose that at a date when the
Queen’s men were still active the Admiral’s or Strange’s had already
acquired Tarlton’s <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>, in the ‘plot’ of which ‘R.
Burbadg’ is cast for the important characters of Gorboduc and Terens.
But perhaps it is even less probable that, after the breach of the
Admiral’s with his father in 1591, he took part in the performances of
the same play by the amalgamated Admiral’s and Strange’s men at the
Rose in 1592. His name does not appear amongst those of the Strange’s
men who were travelling in 1593. But when the amalgamation broke up,
and the Chamberlain’s company was formed, with some of its elements
as a nucleus, in 1594, he joined that company, and became a prominent
member, often acting as its representative or payee, both before and
after its metamorphosis into the King’s men, and to the end of his
own life. His name is constant in its lists (cf. ch. xiii), and his
personal relations with his fellows are reflected in the wills of
Augustine Phillips in 1605, Shakespeare in 1616, and Nicholas Tooley,
whose ‘master’ he had been, in 1623. It would appear that in the
somewhat irregular disposition of James Burbadge’s theatrical interests
the Blackfriars freehold fell primarily to Richard. The leases of 1608
were made by him as lessor to his brother and other members of the
King’s men’s syndicate as lessees. This, however, was doubtless a mere
family arrangement, for Cuthbert spoke of the Blackfriars in 1635 as
‘our inheritance’, and the two brothers shared in the supplementary
transactions which rounded off the original purchase (cf. ch. xvii).
At the Globe, on the other hand, Cuthbert and Richard held in common
a moiety of the housekeepers’ interest under the lease from Nicholas
Brend (cf. ch. xvi). They continued to live as close neighbours in
Halliwell Street, Shoreditch, where they shared the misfortune of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
having their houses burgled in 1615 (Jeaffreson, ii. 108) and where the
registers of St. Leonard’s (Stopes, 139) record Richard’s children:
Richard (bur. 16 August 1607), Julia or Juliet (bapt. 2 January 1603,
bur. 12 September 1608), Frances (bapt. 16 September and bur. 19
September 1604), Anne (bapt. 8 August 1607), Winifred (bapt. 10 October
1613, bur. 14 October 1616), a second Julia (bapt. 26 December 1614,
bur. 15 August 1615), William (bapt. 6 November 1616), and a posthumous
Sara (bapt. 5 August 1619, bur. 29 April 1625). ‘Richard Burbadge,
player’ was himself buried on 16 March 1619. He had died, not as Camden
records in his <i>Annals</i> on 9 March, but on 13 March, after making
the day before a nuncupative will (Collier, iii. 293), witnessed by his
brother and by Nicholas Tooley and Richard Robinson of the King’s men,
in which he left his wife Winifred sole executrix. She subsequently
married Richard Robinson, and was still alive, as was Burbadge’s son
William, in 1635 (<i>Sharers Papers</i>). According to the gossip of
the day he left ‘better than £300 land to his heirs’ (Collier, iii.
297).</p>

<p>Burbadge had a high reputation as a player, both in life and after
death. A note of 13 March 1602 by John Manningham (<i>Diary</i>,
39) records how his impersonation of Richard III touched the
heart of a citizen’s wife, and how Shakespeare prevented him at a
resultant assignation. John Davies of Hereford coupled him with
Shakespeare in 1603 (<i>Microcosmos</i>) among players whom he loved
‘for painting, poesie’, and in 1609 (<i>Civile Warres of Death and
Fortune</i>) amongst those whom Fortune ‘guerdond not, to their
desarts’. He is introduced <i>in propria persona</i> into <i>2 Return
from Parnassus</i> (1602) and into Marston’s induction to <i>The
Malcontent</i> (1604). Probably he is the ‘one man’ of the London stage
with whom the player in <i>Ratseis Ghost</i> (1605; cf. ch. xviii)
is advised ‘to play Hamlet for a wager’. Jonson, in <i>Bartholomew
Fair</i> (1614), v. iii, makes Cokes ask the master of the puppets,
‘which is your <i>Burbage</i> now?... your best <i>Actor</i>. Your
<i>Field</i>?’ He was apparently the model for the <i>Character of an
Actor</i> in the <i>Characters</i> of 1615 (App. C, No. lxi). And other
evidences of his fame can be traced down to Restoration days in Richard
Corbet’s <i>Iter Boreale</i>, in Sir Richard Baker’s <i>Chronicle</i>
and <i>Theatrum Redivivum</i>, and in Richard Flecknoe’s <i>Short
Discourse of the English Stage</i> and his <i>Euterpe Restored</i>
(cf. Collier, iii. 279; Stopes, 121; <i>Shakespeare’s Centurie of
Prayse</i>, N.S.S., 128, 250).</p>

<p>Shortly after Burbadge’s death, on 20 May 1619, the Earl of Pembroke
wrote to Lord Doncaster in Germany of a great supper given the same
night by the Duke of Lennox to the French ambassador, and adds that
the company were now at the play, ‘which I being tender-harted could
not endure to see so soone after the loss of my old acquaintance
Burbadg’ (E. J. L. Scott in <i>Athenaeum</i> (1882), i. 103). Several
epitaphs and elegies upon Burbadge are preserved. The shortest&mdash;‘Exit
Burbadge’&mdash;was printed in Camden’s <i>Remaines</i> (1674), 541. Another
is by Middleton (Collier, iii. 280, 296). A third, which begins</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span></p>

<p class="p-left">has been the subject of much controversy (cf.
Halliwell-Phillipps, ii. 88; C. M. Ingleby, <i>The Elegy on
Burbadge</i>, in <i>Shakespeare, the Man and the Book</i>, ii. 169). It
exists in two versions, one of 86 lines, the other of 124 lines. Of the
shorter version several undoubtedly genuine manuscripts are known, and
it is probably only by accident that one of these omits ll. 2–5 of the
following passage, which is given completely by all the rest:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Hee’s gone &amp; with him what a world are dead,</div>

        <div>Amazed, thought euen then hee dyed in deed.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">In the longer version ll. 2–5 are not only omitted, but
are replaced by an interpolation of many lines, detailing a number
of parts, some of which belonged to other companies than the King’s,
and are not likely to have been played by Burbadge. No manuscript of
this version is forthcoming, and there can be little doubt that the
interpolation is due to Collier, who referred to the version in his
<i>New Particulars</i> (1836), 27, and published it in his <i>Memoirs
of the Actors</i> (1846), 52, professedly from a manuscript in the
possession of Richard Heber. Of the shorter version I can add to what
has been recorded by others that in <i>Stowe MS.</i> 962, f. 62<sup>v</sup>, I
have found a copy of it, with the title ‘An Elegie on the death of
the famous actor Rich: Burbage, who died 13 Martij A<sup>o</sup>. 1618’, and
an ascription to ‘Jo ffletcher’. Other copies also give the date of
Burbadge’s death, or refer, as do the opening lines themselves, to
the fact that he was skilled not only as an actor but as a limner.
John Davies testifies to this in the verses of 1603 already cited. The
accounts of the Earl of Rutland for the birthday tilt of 1613 contain
the entry, ‘31 Martij, To M<sup>r</sup>. Shakspeare in gold, about my Lordes
impreso, 44<sup>s</sup>. To Richard Burbage for paynting and makyng yt, in gold,
44<sup>s</sup>’; and those for the tilt of 1616, ‘25 Martij, 1616, paid given
Richard Burbidg for my Lordes shelde and for the embleance, 4<sup>li</sup>
18<sup>s</sup>’ (<i>H. M. C. Rutland MSS.</i> iv. 494, 508). The gallery at
Dulwich contains a picture presented by William Cartwright, which is
described in his catalogue as ‘a womans head on a boord done by M<sup>r</sup>.
Burbige y<sup>e</sup> actor’. The inveterate tendency of mankind to guess has led
to suggestions that he may have painted the portrait of himself in the
same gallery, the Chandos portrait of Shakespeare, or the original of
the Droeshout print.</p>

<p>One other record of Burbadge, apart from his company, may be noted. On
31 May 1610 he was employed by the City, with his fellow James Rice,
to deliver a speech to Prince Henry at a water-pageant on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span> the Thames
(cf. ch. iv). Presumably he represented Amphion, ‘a grave and judicious
Prophet-like personage’, and Rice Corinea.</p>

<p class="p-left">CONDELL, HENRY, has been conjectured to be the ‘Harry’ cast for Ferrex
and a Lord in the ‘plot’ of <i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i>, as played
by Strange’s or the Admiral’s about 1590–1. The first definite notice
of him is in the cast of Jonson’s <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>, as
played by the Chamberlain’s men in 1598. Thereafter he appears in all
formal lists of the Chamberlain’s and King’s men, up to the Caroline
patent of 1625, including the list in the First Folio of 1623, of
which, with Heminges, he acted as editor. He is also in all the
casts up to <i>The Humourous Lieutenant</i> (<i>c.</i> 1619). About
this date he presumably ceased to play; his part of the Cardinal in
<i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> had passed to Richard Robinson by 1623.
The fact that he took this part somewhat discredits the conjecture of
John Roberts (<i>Answer to Pope</i>, 1729) that he was a comedian;
nor can the statement of the same writer that he was a printer be
verified. He is staged with other members of the company in Marston’s
<i>Malcontent</i> (1604), and appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span> as ‘Henry Condye’ in the verses
on the burning of the Globe in 1613. He is assigned 26<i>s.</i>
8<i>d.</i> to buy a ring as Shakespeare’s ‘fellowe’ in his will of
1616, and appears also as a legatee in the will of Augustine Phillips
in 1605, as trustee in that of Alexander Cooke in 1614, as executor
and joint residuary legatee in that of Nicholas Tooley in 1623, under
which also his wife and his daughter Elizabeth receive legacies,
and as executor in that of John Underwood in 1625. By 1599 he was
married and apparently settled in St. Mary Aldermanbury, where he held
various parochial offices during 1606–21, and the register records his
children: Elizabeth (bapt. 27 February 1599, bur. 11 April 1599), Anne
(bapt. 4 April 1601, bur. 16 July 1610), Richard (bapt. 18 April 1602),
Elizabeth (bapt. 14 April 1603, bur. 22 April 1603), Elizabeth (bapt.
26 October 1606), Mary (bapt. 30 January 1608, bur. from Hoxton at St.
Leonard’s, Shoreditch, 24 March 1608), Henry (bapt. 6 May 1610, bur.
4 March 1630), William (bapt. 26 May 1611), Edward (bapt. 22 August
1614, bur. 23 August 1614).<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> Subsequently he had a ‘country house’
at Fulham, at which on 10 September 1625 a pamphlet written by certain
players on their travels during the plague, as a reply to Dekker’s
<i>A Rod for Run-awayes</i>, under the title of <i>The Run-awayes
Answer</i>, was addressed to him, with an expression of gratitude for
a ‘free and noble farewell’ which he had given the writers. At Fulham,
too, on 13 December 1627, he made his will, leaving to his widow
Elizabeth, his sons Henry and William, and his daughter Elizabeth,
wife of Herbert Finch, much household property at Aldermanbury and
elsewhere in London, including ‘rents and profits’ by ‘leases and
terms of years’ of ‘messuages houses and places’ in Blackfriars and on
the Bankside, which were to pass for a time to William and ultimately
to the widow.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> Condell had not been an original sharer in the
house of the Globe, but by 1612 had acquired an interest jointly with
Heminges; of the Blackfriars house he was an original sharer in 1608.
<i>The Sharers Papers</i> of 1635 indicate that Mrs. Condell had held
four-sixteenths of the Globe and one-eighth of the Blackfriars, but
had transferred two-sixteenths of the Globe when Taylor and Lowin were
admitted as sharers. A minor legacy in Condell’s will is to his old
servant, Elizabeth Wheaton, of her ‘place or priviledge’ in the Globe
and Blackfriars. Heminges and Cuthbert Burbadge are named as overseers.
Condell was buried on 29 December 1627, and his widow on 3 October
1635, both at St. Mary Aldermanbury.<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">COOKE, ALEXANDER, has been conjectured to be the ‘Sander’ who is cast
in the ‘plot’ of <i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i> as played by Strange’s
or the Admiral’s about 1590–1, for the parts of Videna in <i>Envy</i>
and Progne in <i>Lechery</i>. But, as far as this goes, he might just
as well be the ‘San.’ who took the part of a player in <i>Taming
of a Shrew</i> (1594), ind. 1, which was a Pembroke’s play. Malone
‘presumes’, with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span> rashness, that he performed ‘all the principal
female characters’ in Shakespeare’s plays.<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> It must be doubtful
whether he was on the stage as early as 1592. He is traceable as
a member of the King’s men in the casts of <i>Sejanus</i> (1603),
<i>Volpone</i> (1605), <i>Alchemist</i> (1610), <i>Catiline</i> (1611),
and <i>The Captain</i> (1612–13). The fact that in the first two
of these his name occurs at the end of the lists has been somewhat
hazardously accepted as an indication that he played women’s parts. He
is also in the First Folio list of performers in Shakespeare’s plays.
Augustine Phillips left him a legacy as his ‘fellow’ in 1605.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Cooke and his wife’ commend themselves to Alleyn in his wife’s
letter of 21 October 1603.<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> The token-books of St. Saviour’s,
Southwark, show an Alexander Cooke in Hill’s Rents during 1604, 1607,
1609, and 1610; and the parish register, recording the baptism of
Francis Cooke, son of Alexander, ‘a player’, on 27 October 1605, makes
an identification possible. There were three more children, Rebecca
(bapt. 11 October 1607), Alice (bapt. 3 November 1611), Alexander
(bapt. 20 March 1614). This last was posthumous; the register records
Alexander Cooke’s burial on 25 February 1614.<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> His will, dated
3 January 1614, leaves £50 each to Francis, Rebecca, and the unborn
child, and the residue to his wife.<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> He owned £50 ‘which is in the
hand of my fellowes, as my share of the stock’. He appoints ‘my master
Hemings’, to whom he had presumably been apprenticed, and Condell
trustees for his children, and mentions brothers Ellis and John, of
whom the latter is conjectured by Collier to be the author of Greene’s
<i>Tu Quoque</i>.</p>

travelling with the company. He joined the Chamberlain’s men, probably
on their formation in 1594, and was payee for the company in 1601. The
stage-directions to the Quarto (1600) and Folio texts of <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i>, <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>. ii, show that he played Verges. He is
in the 1603 and 1604 lists of the King’s men, and received a legacy

to have been a sharer in the houses of the Globe or Blackfriars. He is

Council (Dasent, ix. 223, x. 223, 228, xi. 437, xii. 23, xiii. 135,
392, etc.). The ‘Edward’ Dutton of the last entry may be an error. In
1592 the Council (xxii. 493) recommended John the son of Laurence who
had ‘of long tyme served her Majestie’ as Messenger, for admission as
a Queen’s Scholar at Westminster. But this Laurence can hardly have
been the actor, for he was acting as Messenger on 20 May 1580, while
the affray for which Laurence the actor had been committed to the
Marshalsea on 13 April was still uninquired into. Somewhat earlier a
Thomas Dutton was employed as a post between Edward VI’s Council and
Thomas Gresham in Antwerp, and was Gresham’s agent in Hamburg, c.
1571 (Burgon, <i>Gresham</i>, i. 109; ii. 421). It is easier again to
conjecture than to prove a connexion between the actors and the house
of Dutton, which had a hereditary jurisdiction over minstrelsy in
Cheshire (cf. ch. ix), although in this the names John and Laurence
both appear. It is perhaps an accident that two of the recorded
visits of the Queen’s men to Lord Derby’s northern seats in 1588–90
synchronize with visits by a Mr. Dutton (Murray, ii. 296).</p>

<p class="p-left">ECCLESTONE, WILLIAM, appears as a King’s man in the casts of <i>The
Alchemist</i> (1610) and <i>Catiline</i> (1611). Mr. Fleay’s statement
that he joined the company from the Queen’s Revels in 1609 rests upon
a confusion with Field.<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> In 1611 he became a member of the Lady
Elizabeth’s men, but left them in 1613 after playing in <i>The Honest
Man’s Fortune</i> during that year. He returned to the King’s, and his
name is found in the official lists of the company for 1619 and 1621
and in most of the casts of their plays, from <i>Bonduca</i> in 1613–14
to <i>The Spanish Curate</i> in 1622, as well as in the First Folio
list of performers in Shakespeare’s plays. Nicholas Tooley forgave him
a debt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span> in his will of 3 June 1623. As he is not in the Caroline patent
of 1625, he had probably died or retired by that date. He may be the
W. E. who writes commendatory verses to <i>The Wild-goose Chase</i>
in 1652. If he is also the ‘William Eglestone’ whose marriage to Anne
Jacob is recorded in the register of St. Saviour’s, Southwark, on 20
February 1603, he lived to be an old man.<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">EDMONDS, JOHN. Globe lessee, 1612; Chamber of Bristol, 1618–19. The
St. Saviour’s registers record the marriage of a John Edmonds to
Margaret Goodyere on 22 February 1600 and the baptism of children of
John Edmonds, ‘player’, from 6 January 1605 to 17 July 1615 (B. 334).
Probably the two are not identical and the player is the John Edmans
who seems to have married his fellow-legatee, Mary Clarke, of the will
of Thomas Pope (q.v.) in 1604.</p>

of 1552–3 (Feuillerat, <i>Edw. and Mary</i>, 120; cf. <i>Mediaeval
Stage</i>, i. 407). Conjecture may identify him with the Elderton
who brought the Eton boys to Court on 6 January 1573 and the William
Elderton who brought the Westminster boys on 1 January 1574, and with
the rhyming William Elderton, some of whose ballads are preserved and
reprinted in Collier, <i>Old Ballads from Early Printed Copies</i>
(1842, <i>Percy Soc.</i>), 25, 45; H. Huth, <i>Ancient Ballads and
Broadsides</i> (1867, <i>Philobiblon Soc.</i>); and H. L. Collman,
<i>Ballads and Broadsides</i> (1912, <i>Roxburghe Club</i>); or
recorded, with ballads against him, in the Stationers’ Register (Arber,
i. 179, 180, 181, 199, 384, 403, 439; ii. 338, 363, 369, 388, 396,
399; cf. v. lxxvi), while his ‘ale-crammed nose’ and ‘rymes lying a
steepe in ale’ are subject for much humour among the pamphleteers
(Lyly, iii. 398; Nashe, i. 197, 256, 280; iii. 123, 133, 177, 354).
Stowe (<i>Survey</i>, i. 272) makes him an attorney in the sheriff’s
courts at the Guildhall about 1568, but he can hardly be the ‘master
Elderton’ who sat as a justice at the Guildhall in a coining case of
1562 (Machyn, 290). He appears to have been dead by 1592 (Harvey, i.
163; Nashe, i. 280). A recent paper on Elderton by H. E. Rollins is in
<i>S. P.</i> xvii (1920), 199.</p>

<p class="p-left">FIELD, NATHAN, was the son of John Field, preacher and castigator of
the stage (cf. App. C, No. xxxi), and was baptized at St. Giles’s,
Cripplegate, on 17 October 1587 (Collier, iii. 425). His name is
always spelt Nathan in formal contemporary documents, although he was
familiarly known as Nat or Nid. But he appears in many reputable modern
works of learning as Nathaniel. This error perhaps originated with the
compilers of the 1679 Folio of Beaumont and Fletcher, who in four out
of the six actor-lists in which his name is found used the form Nathan
and in two (<i>Loyal Subject</i> and <i>Mad Lover</i>) Nathanael. It
was certainly encouraged by a muddle of Collier, who finding in the
Cripplegate registers that another son of John Field had been baptized
Nathaniel on 13 June 1581, and not realizing that a cranky theological
father might quite well use the names as distinct, thought it necessary
to assume that this Nathaniel had died before 1587. As a matter of
fact, he survived, was apprenticed to a stationer at Michaelmas 1596,
took up his freedom on 3 June 1611, and between 1624 and 1627 published
some books, including two sermons by a third brother, Theophilus
Field, Bishop of Llandaff (McKerrow, <i>Dict.</i> 101). I need hardly
linger over the suggestion that Nathan Field lived a double life as
actor and bookseller. At this time of the apprenticeship he was not
yet nine years old, and he was still a scholar of St. Paul’s Grammar
School when, not earlier than 1600, he was impressed by Nathaniel
Giles and his deputies to serve as one of the Children of the Chapel
(<i>Clifton v. Robinson</i> in Fleay, 128). His education was not
entirely interrupted, for he fell into the hands of Ben Jonson, who
told Drummond in 1619 that ‘Nid Field was his schollar, and he had read
to him the Satyres of Horace, and some Epigrames of Martiall’ (Laing,
11). Field remained a member of the Chapel and the Queen’s Revels
throughout the vicissitudes of the company from 1600 to 1613. He is in
the actor-lists of <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> (1600), <i>The Poetaster</i>
(1601), and <i>Epicoene</i> (1609), and presumably played Humfrey in
<i>K. B. P.</i> (1607).<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> With his fellows he became absorbed into
the Lady Elizabeth’s in March 1613, contracted with Henslowe and Meade
on behalf of this company (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 23), acted as their
payee in 1615, and appears in the actor-lists of <i>The Coxcomb</i>,
<i>The Honest Man’s Fortune</i>, and <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> (1614), in
the text of which Jonson compliments him (v. 3) as follows:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div><i>Cokes.</i> Which is your <i>Burbage</i> now?</div>
        <div class="ph"><i>Lanterne.</i> What meane you by that, Sir?</div>
        <div class="ph"><i>Cokes.</i> Your best Actor. Your <i>Field</i>?</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">He seems to have been suspected by the company of
taking bribes from Henslowe to connive at transactions contrary to
their interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span> (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 88). Certainly he was in
financial straits and on more than one occasion appealed to Henslowe
to secure his release from an arrest (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 66, 67).
Perhaps it was as a result of this friction with his fellows that
he abandoned their amalgamation with Prince Charles’s men in 1615.
Instead he joined, at or about this date, the King’s men, and appears
as one in the actor-lists of <i>The Loyal Subject</i>, <i>The Knight
of Malta</i>, <i>The Queen of Corinth</i>, and <i>The Mad Lover</i>.
It must, I think, have been by a slip that Cuthbert Burbadge, in the
<i>Sharers Papers</i> of 1635, spoke of him as joining the King’s
with Ostler and Underwood in 1608 or 1609. It seems probable that
Field brought with him to the King’s a share of the plays which had
formed the repertory of the joint Lady Elizabeth’s and Queen’s Revels,
including Chapman’s <i>Bussy D’Ambois</i>, in which a King’s prologue
vaunts his success as Bussy. He did not stay with the company very
long, for though he is in the patent of 27 March and the livery list of
19 May 1619, he is replaced by John Rice in the livery list of 7 April
1621. And as he does not appear and Rice does appear amongst the actors
named in the stage-directions to <i>Sir John von Olden Barnevelt</i>
in August 1619, it is probable that he had left in the course of the
summer (<i>M. L. R.</i> iv. 395). If so, his departure synchronizes
with a scandal which attached itself to his name. His moral character
was hardly becoming to the son of a preacher. More than one manuscript
commonplace book (e. g. <i>Ashm. MS.</i> 47, f. 49, which appears
from the spelling of the name to be a late copy) contains an epigram
with some such heading as <i>On Nathaniell Feild suspected for too
much familiarity with his M<sup>ris</sup> Lady May</i>. And on 5 June 1619
Sir William Trumbull wrote from Brussels to Lord Hay (E. J. L. Scott
in <i>Athenaeum</i> (1882), i. 103) that he was told that the Earl of
Argyll had paid for the nursing of a child, ‘which the world sayes is
daughter to my lady and N. Feild the Player’. Lady Argyll was Anne,
daughter of Sir William Cornwallis of Brome. Field’s later life is
obscure. There is an unimportant jest about him in John Taylor’s <i>Wit
and Mirth</i> (1629). He was married to a wife Anne, and had children
baptized and buried at St. Anne’s, Blackfriars, during 1619–25. If
another epigram, printed by Collier, iii. 437, can be trusted, he very
properly suffered from jealousy. In relevant register entries the
name is given as Nathan. The Blackfriars registers give children both
of Nathan and of Nathaniel Field, and on 20 February 1633 occurs the
burial of Nathaniel Field, whom, if the entry does not indicate that
the confusion of persons had already begun, we are bound to take to be
the bookseller. There is no reason why both brothers should not have
resided in Blackfriars.</p>

<p>Field was dramatist, as well as actor. In addition to the two plays
published under his single name, he collaborated with Massinger in
<i>The Fatal Dowry</i>, which was a King’s play and not likely,
therefore, to fall outside the dates 1616–19. And as the Henslowe
correspondence (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 65, 84) show him as
collaborating also with Fletcher, Massinger, and Daborne for the Lady
Elizabeth’s, he has been conjectured as a possible sharer in the
authorship of several of the plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher series.
He also, about the time of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span> joining the King’s, wrote a defence of
the stage, in the form of a remonstrance to Mr. Sutton, a preacher of
St. Mary Overies (App. C, No. lxiii). A portrait of Field is at Dulwich.</p>

<p class="p-left">FLETCHER, LAWRENCE. Scotland, 1595, 1599, 1601; Admiral’s (?), 1596;
King’s, 1603. Although included as a King’s man in the royal patent,
there is no reason to suppose that Fletcher ever joined the company
acting at the Globe; the absence of his name from the actor-list in the
Shakespeare F<sub>1</sub> of 1623 is strong evidence that he did not. He lived
in St. Saviour’s, where he had a homonym, a victualler, who survived
him. One of the two is shown by the token-books as housed in Hunt’s
Rents, Maid Lane, during 1605–7; probably this was the actor, who was
buried on 12 September 1608. The description ‘Lawrence Fletcher, a man:
in the church’ of the register is amplified in a fee-book to ‘Lawrence
Fletcher, a player, the King’s servant, buried in the church, with an
afternoon’s knell of the great bell, 20s.’ (Collier, <i>Memoirs of the

he belonged at an early date to the King’s men. He is a legatee in
Thomas Pope’s will of 22 July 1603, and witnessed that of Augustine
Phillips on 4 May 1605, in which Phillips names a sister Elizabeth
Goughe, doubtless the Elizabeth &mdash;&mdash; recorded in the register of St.
Saviour’s, Southwark, as marrying Robert Gough on 13 February 1603. The
token-books of St. Saviour’s indicate Gough’s residence in Hill’s Rents
during 1604, Samson’s Rents during 1605 and 1606, and Austin’s Rents
in 1612–22; and the registers, which generally call him a ‘player’,

same volume, is known to have had a wife Rebecca, and may fairly be
identified with the ‘John Hemminge, gent.’ of St. Mary Cornhill,
who was married on 10 March 1588 to Rebecca Knell, widow, relict of
William Knell, gent., late of St. Mary Aldermanbury. In the same parish
William Knell had married Rebecca Edwards on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span> 30 January 1586, and an
older William Knell had been buried on 24 September 1578.<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> One
of these was not improbably the early actor celebrated by Heywood.
Malone found a family of Heming at Shottery, and conjectured that of
this family John was born at some date earlier than the opening of
the Stratford-on-Avon register in 1558.<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> But this is rendered
improbable by a confirmation of arms in 1629 to ‘John Hemings of London
Gent. of long tyme Servant to Queen Elizabeth of happie Memory, also
to King James hir Royal Successor and to King Charles his Sonne’,
in which he is described as ‘Sonne and Heire of George Hemings of
Draytwiche in the Countye of Worcester Gent.’<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> There seems little
reason to doubt that this John Hemings is the player. He very probably
began his theatrical career with the Queen’s company, to which also
Knell had belonged. By May 1593, however, he had joined Strange’s
men, from whom he passed to the Chamberlain’s men, probably on the
original formation in 1594. Of this company, afterwards the King’s
men, he remained a member to the end of his career. He appears in all
the official lists of the company up to 1629, and regularly acted as
their payee for Court performances, generally with a colleague from
1596 to 1601, and thereafter alone. This and his prominence in the
negotiations of the company and the lawsuits arising out of them,
suggest that he acted as their business manager. As an actor he appears
in all the casts up to <i>Catiline</i> in 1611, but not thereafter;
possibly he may have resigned acting, and devoted himself to business.
The unreliable John Roberts, <i>Answer to Pope</i> (1729), conjectures
that he was a ‘tragedian’. Malone had seen a statement in some tract of
which he had forgotten the title, that he was the original performer
of Falstaff.<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> The lines on the burning of the Globe in 1613 thus
describe him:</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">He is ‘old Master Hemings’ in Jonson’s <i>Masque of
Christmas</i> (1616). He lent his ‘boy’ John Rice (q.v.) to the
Merchant Taylors for their entertainment of James on 16 July 1607, and
another ‘boy’ for Chapman’s mask of 1613. He is named as a legatee and
overseer in the will of Augustine Phillips in 1605, and as executor in
the event of the widow’s re-marriage; also as a trustee in the will of
Alexander Cooke, who calls him his ‘master’, in 1614; as a witness in
that of Richard Cowley in 1618; as a legatee in that of Shakespeare
in 1616; and as a legatee and overseer in those of Underwood in 1624
and of Condell in 1627. He was appointed a trustee for Shakespeare’s
Blackfriars property in 1613,<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> and acted with Condell as editor
of the First Folio of the plays in 1623. This fact is probably the
origin of the statement of Roberts that he was engaged with Condell in
business as a printer. He filled various parochial posts from 1608 to
1619 in St. Mary’s, Aldermanbury, and the registers contain records of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span> following children: Alice (bapt. 10 November 1590, married John
Atkins 11 February 1612), Mary (bapt. 26 May 1592, bur. 9 August 1592),
Judith (bapt. 29 August 1593), Thomasine (bapt. 15 January 1595), Joan
(bapt. 2 May 1596), John (bapt. 12 August 1599), Beavis (bapt. 24 May
1601), William (bapt. 3 October 1602), George (bapt. 12 Feb. 1604),
Rebecca (bapt. 4 February 1605), Elizabeth (bapt. 6 March 1608), Mary
(bapt. 21 June 1611, bur. 23 July 1611).<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> In the same parish ‘John
Heminge, player’ was himself buried on 12 October 1630, beside his
wife Rebecca, who preceded him on 2 September 1619. He is registered
as a ‘stranger’ and was therefore probably residing elsewhere. In his
will, made on 9 October, he describes himself as ‘citizen and grocer
of London’, appoints his son William executor and trustee for his
unmarried and unadvanced children, and Cuthbert Burbadge and ‘Mr.
Rice’, possibly the actor, overseers, and leaves legacies to his
daughters Rebecca, wife of Captain William Smith, Margaret, wife of Mr.
Thomas Sheppard, who is not mentioned in the register, Elizabeth, and
Mrs. Merefield, and to his son-in-law Atkins ‘and his now wife’, and
his grandchild Richard Atkins. He also leaves 10<i>s.</i> for a ring
‘unto every of my fellows and sharers, his majesties servants.<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>
William Heminges went to Westminster and Christ Church, and became a
playwright.<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> Unnamed in the will is Thomasine, who may have been
dead, but certainly had quarrelled seriously with her father. She had
married William Ostler of the King’s men in 1611 and her son Beaumont
was baptized at St. Mary’s, Aldermanbury, on 18 May 1612. Ostler died
intestate on 16 December 1614 in possession of shares in the leases
both of the Globe and the Blackfriars. These passed of right to
Thomasine as his administratrix, and formed all the provision left for
her maintenance and her husband’s debts. The leases, however, passed
into the hands of Heminges, who retained them and asserted that Ostler
had created a trust, of which Thomasine declared that she knew nothing.
On 20 September 1615 she entered a bill in Chancery against her father,
and subpœnaed him to appear during the coming Michaelmas term. On 26
September Heminges promised that if she would withdraw her suit, and
would also ‘doe her dutie’ to him and to her mother Rebecca, he would
satisfy her to the value of the shares. Thomasine states that on the
same day kneeling and in tears she made her submission at her father’s
house in Aldermanbury. She also stayed her suit, but Heminges, although
called upon to fulfil his promise on 5 October, failed to do so, and
on 9 October Thomasine brought a common law action against him for
damages to the amount of £600, which she estimated to be the value of
the shares.<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> The issue of the case is unknown, but it would seem
probable from the <i>Sharers Papers</i> of 1635 that Heminges succeeded
in retaining the shares, and that at his death they passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> to his son
William. Professor Wallace states that in 1616 Thomasine Ostler was
involved in another lawsuit with Walter Raleigh, son of Sir Walter,
and obtained a verdict of £250 against him for insult and slander.
One way and another, Heminges seems to have acquired a considerable
financial interest in the Globe and Blackfriars. He had an original
seventh of a moiety of the Globe lease in 1599, and an original seventh
of the Blackfriars lease in 1608. But as executor to Phillips (q.v.)
and otherwise he had opportunities of adding to these holdings. The
<i>Sharers Papers</i> show that at his death he had four sixteenths of
the Globe and probably two eighths of the Blackfriars; and these, or
some of them, he had enjoyed ‘thirty yeeres without any molestacion,
beeing the most of the sayd yeeres both player and houskeeper, and
after hee gave over playing diverse yeeres’. In <i>Witter v. Heminges
and Condell</i> he is described as being in 1619 of ‘greate lyveinge
wealth and power’.<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> The play-house shares seem to have been the
chief part of the property left by his will. They passed to William
Heminges as his executor. He seems to have gradually disposed of them,
first selling one share in the Globe by arrangement with the company to
Taylor and Lowin, and later, by transactions which some of his fellows
resented, one share in each house to John Shank during 1633 for £156,
and the remaining shares also to John Shank during 1634, for £350. He
was then in difficulties, and Shank disbursed additional small sums
to him in prison. It was these sales to Shank which brought about the
petition to the Lord Chamberlain recorded in the <i>Sharers Papers</i>.</p>

<p class="p-left">HENSLOWE, FRANCIS. Queen’s, 1594; Lennox’s, 1605. He was son of Richard
and nephew of Philip Henslowe, and various entries in the diary and
other Dulwich MSS. record his imprisonments, more than once on criminal
charges, his employment during 1593–4 in his uncle’s pawnbroking, and
his loans, one of which on 1 June 1595 was of £9 ‘to laye downe for his
hallfe share with the company which he dothe playe with all’ (H. i. 6),
conceivably, as Dr. Greg suggests, some company other than the Queen’s,
in which he had already acquired a half share in 1594. He dwelt in
the Clink in 1594, took a house called the Upper Ground on Bankside
in 1597, and was of St. George’s, Southwark, in 1606, in which year,
between 30 March and 6 October, both he and his wife died (H. ii. 277).</p>

elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> He probably emerges as one of Leicester’s men in the
Low Countries during 1585–6 and thence made his way to Denmark. He
was in London and had already won a comic reputation by 1590 when the
dedication of <i>An Almond for a Parrat</i> (Nashe, iii. 341), ‘To that
most Comicall and conceited Caualeire Monsieur du Kempe, Jestmonger
and Vice-gerent generall to the Ghost of Dicke Tarlton,’ tells how
the anonymous author, possibly Nashe, had been asked by ‘that famous
Francatrip’ Harlicken’ at Bergamo in the previous summer, whether
he knew ‘any such Parabolano here in London as Signior Chiarlatano
Kempino’ of whose ‘pleasance’ Harlicken had heard ‘report’. In <i>Four
Letters Confuted</i> (1592) Nashe says of an action of Harvey’s, ‘Will
Kempe, I mistrust it will fall to thy lot for a merriment, one of these
dayes’ (i. 287). An example of Kempe’s merriments is to be found in sc.
xii of <i>A Knack to Know a Knave</i> (1594) played by Strange’s men,
to whom Kempe belonged by 1593. He was also famous for his jigs. Four
of these are entered in the Stationers’ Register during 1591–5 (cf. ch.
xviii) but are not preserved, and ‘Kemps jiggs’ is the heading to some
music collected by John Dowland and preserved in <i>Camb. Univ. Libr.
MS.</i> Dd. ii. 11 (cf. Halliwell, <i>MS. Rarities</i>, 8). Marston
(iii. 372), <i>Scourge of Villainy</i> (1598), sat. xi. 30, ‘the orbs
celestial Will dance Kempe’s jig,’ and E. Guilpin, <i>Skialetheia</i>
(1598), sat. v, ‘Whores, bedles, bawdes, and sergeants filthily Chaunt
Kemps Jigge, or the Burgonians tragedy,’ show his vogue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> In 1594–5 he
was one of the recently constituted Chamberlain’s men and the intrusion
of his name into stage-directions to <i>R. J.</i> iv. 5. 102 (Q<sub>2</sub>)
and <i>M. Ado</i>, iv. 2, shows that he played Peter in the one play
and Dogberry in the other. Oddly enough, one of his speeches (iv. 2.
4) in <i>M. Ado</i> is assigned to ‘Andrew’, possibly a generic name
for a clown or ‘merry-Andrew’. He is in the actor-list of <i>Every Man
in his Humour</i> (1598) but not in that of <i>Every Man out of his
Humour</i> (1599), and this fact, together with his sale of his share
in the Globe soon after the lease of 21 February 1599 was signed,
points to his leaving the company. ‘Would I had one of Kemps shooes
to throw after you,’ says a speaker in <i>E. M. O.</i> <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v
(q.v.). This may be an allusion to some clownery by Kempe, perhaps in
a performance with some other company at the Curtain in the autumn of
1599 after the Chamberlain’s left that house; or, less probably, to
Kempe’s famous morris-dance for a wager from London to Norwich, at the
end of which he hung his buskins in the Guildhall, for this began on
11 February 1600 and ended on 11 March, the year being fixed by the
mayoralty (1599–1600) of Roger Weld at Norwich. Another allusion to
‘Kemps morice’ is in <i>Jack Drum’s Entertainment</i> (1600), i. 45.
Dudley Carleton wrote to John Chamberlain on 13 October 1600 (<i>S.
P. D. Eliz.</i> cclxxv. 93) that on his way from Witham to Englefield
‘we met a company of mad wenches, whereof M<sup>rs</sup>. Mary Wroughton and
young Stafford were ringleaders, who travelled from house to house, and
to some places where they were little known, attended with a concert
of musicians, as if they had undertaken the like adventure as Kemp
did from London to Norwich’. Kempe’s own account of his adventure was
entered in the Stationers’ Register as ‘Kemps morris to Norwiche’ on
22 April 1600 (Arber, iii. 160). In the Epistle to Anne Fitton, whom,
possibly by confusion with her sister Mary, he describes as maid of
honour to Elizabeth, he refers to unentered ballads on the subject,
and when he says that ‘I haue daunst my selfe out of the world’ is
not improbably jesting on his departure from the Globe. At the end he
foreshadows crossing to Calais, which he no doubt did. A John Kemp,
who was in charge of a touring company, which had been in Holland and
reached Münster by November 1601, may have been a relative. But William
Kempe had returned to England, after visiting Italy as well as Germany,
on 2 September 1601, as is shown by the following interpolation in
a diary of one William Smith of Abingdon, in <i>Sloane MS.</i> 414,
f. 56 (wrongly cited by Halliwell, <i>Ludus Coventriae</i> 410, as
<i>Sloane MS.</i> 392, f. 401; cf. F. J. Furnivall in <i>N.S.S. Trans.
1880–6</i>, 65):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Sep. 2. Kemp, mimus quidam, qui peregrinationem quandam in
Germaniam et Italiam instituerat, post multos errores, et
infortunia sua, reversus: multa refert de Anthonio Sherley,
equite aurato, quem Romae (legatum Persicum agentem) convenerat.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Possibly Kempe rejoined the Chamberlain’s for a while.
In <i>3 Parnassus</i> (? January 1602), iv. 3, he is introduced as a
fellow of Burbadge and Shakespeare, and greeted with allusions to his
‘dancing the morrice ouer the Alpes’ and ‘the Emperour of Germany’.
But on 10 March<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span> 1602 he had a loan from Henslowe, and during the
winter of 1602–3 he was certainly one of Worcester’s men. The dates
do not lend support to the suggestion of Fleay, ii. 20, that he had
already in 1599–1600 been at the Rose with Pembroke’s men. After the
end of Elizabeth’s reign he is not traceable, and he is mentioned as
dead in Heywood, <i>Apology</i> (<i>c.</i> 1608), and dead or retired
in Dekker, <i>Gull’s Hornbook</i> (1609), 11, ‘Tarlton, Kemp, nor
Singer, nor all the litter of fools that now come drawling behind them,
never played the clown more naturally.’ A William Kempe is recorded in
token-books of St. Saviour’s, Southwark, as living in Samson’s Rents in
1595, 1596, 1598, and 1599, in Langley’s New Rents in 1602, and later
near the old play-house (Collier, iii. 351, and <i>Bodl.</i>; Rendle,
<i>Bankside</i>, xxvi). Collier, but not Rendle, gives the date ‘1605’
for the last entry, probably with a view to supporting his notice of
Kempe, as playing with Armin at the Blackfriars (q.v.) in 1605, which
is doubtless a fabrication. On the other hand, though the date is
plausible, the notice of ‘Kempe a man’ as buried at St. Saviour’s on
2 November 1603 (Rendle, xxvii) is not so worded as to be absolutely
conclusive. The name was a common one, and Collier, <i>Actors</i>,
xxxvi, gives notices of it from other parishes. In T. Weelkes, <i>Ayres
on Phantasticke Sprites</i> (1608), it is said of Kempe that ‘into
France He took pains to skip it’. His visit to Venice and meeting with
Sherley are dramatized in <i>Travels of Three English Brothers</i>
(1607) and apparently misdated after the <i>Englands Joy</i> of
November 1602. Finally, an epitaph upon him is in R. Braithwaite,
<i>Remains after Death</i> (1618), sig. <span class="allsmcap">F</span> 8<sup>v</sup>, which suggests
that he died not long after his morris.</p>

<p class="p-left">LOWIN, JOHN, was a member of Worcester’s company during their season of
1602–3 with Henslowe at the Rose. On 12 March 1603 Henslowe lent him
money to go into the country with the company, but during the course
of the year he must have transferred his services to the King’s men,
presumably as a hireling, since, although in the cast of <i>Sejanus</i>
(1603) and the Induction to <i>Malcontent</i> (1604) he is not in the
official lists of 1603 and 1604. A portrait of him in the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford, has the inscription ‘1640, Aetat. 64’, and he may
therefore be identified with the John, son of Richard Lowen, baptized
at St. Giles’s, Cripplegate, on 9 December 1576. If so, his father
seems to have been a carpenter, and he had a sister Susan and a brother
William.<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> He remained through a long life with the King’s men,
appearing in most of the casts, in the actor-list of the First Folio,
and in the official lists from 1619 onwards. He played Bosola in
<i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>. A pamphlet entitled <i>Conclusions upon
Dances</i> (1607) has a dedication to Lord Denny, dated 23 November
1606, and signed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span> ‘I. L. <i>Roscio</i>’. Collier claims to have
found in a copy of this the note ‘By Jhon Lowin. Witnesseth Tho. D.
1610’.<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> A John Lowen married Joan Hall, widow, by licence, in St.
Botolph’s, Bishopsgate, on 29 October 1607.<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> Shortly afterwards a
John Lowin was paying a poor-rate of 2<i>d.</i> weekly in the liberty
of the Clink. The Southwark token-books attest his residence ‘near the
play-house’ and in other parts of the parish at various dates from
1601 to 1642.<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> He was overseer of Paris Garden in 1617–18.<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>
But in 1623 he lived in Lambeth (J. 348). He is named as a legatee
and overseer in the will of his ‘fellow’ John Underwood in 1624. It
appears from the <i>Sharers Papers</i> that he had no interest in the
play-houses until after the death of Heminges in 1630, when he was
admitted to purchase two sixteenths of the Globe and one eighth of
the Blackfriars. From this time onwards he seems to have shared the
business responsibilities of the company with Joseph Taylor. He was
also prominent as an actor.<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> Wright enumerates amongst his parts
Shakespeare’s Falstaff; but when Roberts adds Hamlet and Henry VIII,
he is presumably guessing that Lowin was ‘fat and scant of breath’.
He may have been the original Henry VIII, for Downes reports that
Betterton was instructed in the part by Sir William Davenant, ‘who had
it from old Mr. Lowen, that had his instructions from Mr. Shakespeare
himself’.<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> Wright tells us that at the outbreak of civil war he
was ‘superannuated’, and ‘in his latter days kept an inn (the Three
Pigeons) at Brentford, where he dyed very old (for he was an actor of
eminent note in the reign of King James the First), and his poverty
was as great as his age’.<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> He signed with Taylor the dedication
to Fletcher’s <i>The Wild-goose Chase</i> in 1652, the publication
of which was an attempt to relieve their necessities. A ‘John Lewin’
who left a widow Martha, was buried at St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields on
18 March 1659, and a ‘John Lowen’ at St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, on 16
March 1669.<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> Probably a G. Lowin who played Barnaveldt’s daughter
to Lowin’s Barnaveldt in 1619 was his son.</p>

Captain</i>, <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>, in which he took the part of
Antonio, <i>Valentinian</i>, and <i>Bonduca</i>. The following epigram
in John Davies, <i>Scourge of Folly</i> (<i>c.</i> 1611), attests his
fame and his participation in some forgotten brawl:</p>

for while the St. Saviour’s registers record the burial of Robert

<p class="p-left">PHILLIPS, AUGUSTINE, is included in the 1593 list of Strange’s men,
and played for them or the Admiral’s in <i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i>
about 1590–1 as ‘Mr. Phillipps’. Probably he joined the Chamberlain’s
men on their formation in 1594. He appears in the actor-lists of
1598 and 1599, was one of the original Globe shareholders of 1599,
and on 18 February 1601 gave evidence as to the performance of
<i>Richard II</i> by the company before the Essex rising. He is
also in the official lists of the King’s men in 1603 and 1604, in
the actor-list of <i>Sejanus</i> in 1603, and in that of the First
Folio of Shakespeare’s plays. ‘Phillips his gygg of the slyppers’ was
entered in the Stationers’ Register on 26 May 1595 (cf. p. 552). It
has been conjectured that Phillips was a brother-in-law of Alleyn,
to whom Henslowe wrote on 28 September 1593, ‘Your sister Phillipes
&amp; her husband hath leced two or thre owt of ther howsse, yt they in
good health &amp; doth hartily comend them unto you.’ If so, his wife was
probably Elizabeth Woodward. But it is also possible that the family in
question was that of one Edward Phillipes, who was also in relations
with Henslowe and Alleyn.<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> An Augustine Phillipps buried at St.
Saviour’s, Southwark, in 1592, was probably a relative of the actor,
whose children the register of the same parish records as Magdalen
(bapt. 29 September 1594), Rebecca (bapt. 11 July 1596), and Austen or
Augustine (bapt. 29 November 1601, bur. 1 July 1604). The father is
designated <i>histrio</i>, ‘player,’ or ‘player of interludes’. The
parish token-books show that he dwelt in Horseshoe Court during 1593
and 1595, thereafter near the Swan in Paris Garden, in Montagu Close
during 1601, in ‘Bradshaw’s Rents’ during 1602, and in Horseshoe Court
again during 1604.<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> But by 4 May 1605, when he made his will,
he was of Mortlake, Surrey, where he had a house and land of which
he had lately purchased the lease.<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> Doubtless he had prospered.
A note of heraldic irregularities delivered by William Smith, Rouge
dragon, to the Earl of Northampton as commissioner for the Earl Marshal
states that ‘Phillipps the player had graven in a gold ring the armes

quartred, which I shewed to M<sup>r</sup>. York at a small gravers shopp in
Foster Lane’.<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> The will mentions Phillips’s wife, whose name was
not Elizabeth but Anne, his daughters Magdalen, Rebecca, Anne, and
Elizabeth, his mother Agnes Bennett, his brothers William and James
Webb, his sister Margery Borne, and her sons Miles and Philipps, and
his sister Elizabeth Gough. Elizabeth had been married at St. Saviour’s
in 1603, to Robert Gough (q.v.) of the King’s men, who witnesses the
will.<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> Margery Borne may have been the wife of William Borne
<i>alias</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span> Bird (q.v.) of the Prince’s men. Presumably the Webbs
were his brothers-in-law, in which case his wife was obviously not a
Woodward. There are legacies of £5 to ‘the hyred men of the company
which I am of’, of 30<i>s.</i> pieces to his ‘fellows’ William
Shakespeare and Henry Condell, and his ‘servant’ Christopher Beeston,
of 20<i>s.</i> pieces to his ‘fellows’ Laurence Fletcher, Robert Armin,
Richard Cowley, Alexander Cook and Nicholas Tooley, of silver bowls
to John Heminges, Richard Burbadge, and William Sly, and of £20 to
Timothy Whithorne. Samuel Gilburne, ‘my late apprentice’ is to have
40<i>s.</i> and ‘my mouse colloured velvit hose and a white taffety
dublet, a blacke taffety sute, my purple cloke, sword, and dagger, and
my base viall’. James Sands ‘my apprentice’ is to have 40<i>s.</i> and
‘a citterne, a bandore and a lute’. The widow is appointed executrix,
but if she re-marries she is to have ‘no parte or porcion of my goods
or chattells’, and is to be replaced by the overseers of the will,
Heminges, Richard Burbadge, Sly, and Whithorne. After proving the will
on 13 May 1605, the widow did in fact re-marry, with John Witter, and
it was proved again by John Heminges on 16 May 1607. His share in
the Globe was subsequently the subject of litigation.<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> Heywood

played as ‘Mr. Pope’ for them or the Admiral’s in <i>2 Deadly Sins</i>
about 1590–1. He joined the Chamberlain’s men, probably on their
foundation in 1594, was joint payee for them with Heminge from 1597–9,
and appears in the actor-lists of 1598 and 1599. On 30 August 1598,
William Bird borrowed 10<i>s.</i> of Henslowe, ‘to folowe the sewt
agenst Thomas Poope’.<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> In 1600 he is mentioned, with Singer of the

<p class="p-left">He had an original fifth share of a moiety of the Globe, increased to a
fourth on the retirement of Kempe. But he does not appear in the lists
of the King’s men, and had therefore probably retired by 1603. On 22
July of that year he made his will, which was proved on 13 February
1604.<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> He leaves his interests in the Globe and Curtain to Mary
Clark, <i>alias</i> Wood, and Thomas Bromley, and legacies to Robert
Gough and John Edmans. He mentions the house in Southwark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> in which he
dwelt, held with other tenements of the late Francis Langley; also his
brothers John and William Pope, and his mother Agnes Webbe. This hardly
justifies Collier in connecting him with the Webbes of Snitterfield,
Shakespeare’s kin. Bazell Nicholl, scrivener, and John Wrench, are
left executors. As in 1612 a sixth of the Globe was in the hands of
Basil Nicoll and John and Mary Edmonds, it is probable that John
Edmonds married Mary Clark. It appears from the Southwark token-books
that one Pope lived in Blamer’s Rents during 1593, in Wrench’s Rents
during 1595, and in Mr. Langley’s New Rents during 1596, 1598, 1600,
and 1602.<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> Dr. Greg thinks that Thomas Pope, rather than a Morgan
Pope who also had interests in Southwark, was the ‘Mr. Pope’ with whom
Henslowe had an interview on 25 June 1603, ‘at the scryveners shope
wher he lisse’, concerning the renewal of the lease of the Rose.<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a>
But Thomas Pope clearly lived in his own house. Collier (<i>Actors</i>,
xxxvi) gives a marriage of a Thomas Pope and Elizabeth Baly at St.
Botolph’s on 20 December 1584, but the indications of the will do not
suggest a married man. William Smith complains that ‘Pope the player
would have no other armes but the armes of Sir Thomas Pope, Chancelor
of y<sup>e</sup> Augmentations’.<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> Heywood mentions the ‘deserts’ of Pope in
his <i>Apology</i>. He is included in the actor-list of the First Folio
Shakespeare.</p>

<p class="p-left">RICE, JOHN, was ‘boy’ to Heminges when he delivered a speech in

the water-pageant of 31 May 1610. He became one of the original Lady
Elizabeth’s men in 1611, and seems to have joined the King’s men
again in 1619. The Southwark token-books indicate a John Rice as a
resident in 1615, 1619, 1621, and 1623, with an ‘uxor’ in 1621, and
another record names John Rice ‘of the Bankside’ amongst players in
1623.<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> He is not in the official list of May of that year, but
played in <i>Sir John van Olden Barnavelt</i> about August, and is in
the official list of 1621. He is traceable up to the list of 1625, but
is not in that of 1629. It is not improbable that he retired, and went
into Orders, for Heminges, in his will of 1630, leaves 20<i>s.</i>
to ‘John Rice, clerk, of St. Saviour’s in Southwark’, and also names
‘Mr. Rice’ as overseer. Rice is in the actor-list of the First Folio

<p class="p-left">ROBINSON, RICHARD, first appears in the <i>Catiline</i> actor-list of
the King’s men in 1611, and as playing the Lady in a stage direction
(l. 1929) to <i>The Second Maiden’s Tragedy</i> of the same year. In
<i>The Devil is an Ass</i> (1616), ii. 8. 64, Merecroft describes
‘Dicke Robinson’ as a lad, and as masquerading ‘drest like a lawyer’s
wife’. I think it not impossible that he was a son of James Robinson,
who was a member of the Children of the Chapel syndicate in 1600. If
so, he may have been a Blackfriars boy. He played in <i>Bonduca</i>
(<i>c.</i> 1613), is in the 1619 patent to the King’s men, and in
the actor-list of the First Folio Shakespeare, and is traceable as a
King’s man up to the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647. He may have
married Richard Burbadge’s widow, who held shares in the Globe and
Blackfriars as Mrs. Robinson in 1635. He owed Tooley £29 13<i>s.</i>
when the latter made his will in 1623. According to Wright he was a
comedian. The same author states that he took up arms for the King,
and was killed by Major Harrison at the taking of Basing House, on
14 October 1645. A contemporary report of this event by Hugh Peters
confirms the death of ‘Robinson, the player, who, a little before the
storm, was known to be mocking and scorning the Parliament’. There
were, however, other actors named Robinson, and probably this was one
of them. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span> Richard had been killed in 1645, he could not have signed
the dedication of the Beaumont and Fletcher plays in 1647. Moreover,
the register of St. Anne’s, Blackfriars, records the burial of ‘Richard
Robinson, a player’ on 23 March 1648.<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> He seems to have lived at

<p class="p-left">SHANK, JOHN, or SHANKS, for the name is variously spelt, describes
himself to Lord Chamberlain Pembroke in the <i>Sharers Papers</i> of
1635 as ‘beeing an old man in this quality, who in his youth first
served your noble father, and after that the late Queene Elizabeth,
then King James, and now his royall Majestye’.<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Presumably the
Pembroke’s company in question was that of 1597–1600, and the Queen
Elizabeth’s men the travelling company of the latter years of the
reign. Shank’s account of his own career may be amplified from the
records of his name in the 1610 list of Prince Henry’s men and in
the patent issued to the same company when they became the Elector
Palatine’s men in 1613. He lived in Rochester Yard, Southwark, in
1605, but the register of St. Giles’s, Cripplegate, shows him later in
Golden Lane, and records several baptisms and burials of his children
between 1610 and 1629.<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> He had joined the King’s men between 1613
and 1619, as his name is in the patent of the latter year. It recurs in
the official lists of the company up to 1629, but occasionally only in
actor-lists up to 1631, including that of the First Folio Shakespeare.
Amongst his ‘boyes’ or apprentices were Thomas Pollard, John Thompson,
John Honiman, and Thomas Holcome. Thompson cost him £40; for other boys
he had spent by 1635 as much as £200. After the death of John Heminges,
Shank bought from his son William, surreptitiously, as his fellows
averred, two shares in the Blackfriars and three in the Globe, for a
total sum of £506. It was these transactions, which took place between
1633 and 1635, that led to the petition of Benfield, Swanston, and
Pollard to the Lord Chamberlain recorded in the <i>Sharers Papers</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
As a result Shank was directed to transfer one share in each house
to the petitioners. He, however, complained that he could not get
satisfactory terms from them, and that they restrained him from the
stage. The Cripplegate register records Shank’s burial on 27 January
1636.<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> James Wright calls him a ‘comedian’,<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> and the following
verses, signed W. Turner, and quoted by Collier from Turner’s <i>Dish
of Stuff, or a Gallimaufry</i>, may perhaps be taken as confirming

with Pope (q. v.) in 1600, and Dekker, <i>Gull’s Horn Book</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> (1609),
says, ‘Tarlton, Kemp, nor Singer, nor all the litter of fooles that now
come drawling behind them, never played the clowns more naturally than
the arrantest sot of you all shall’. Heywood praised him as dead in the
same year (H. ii. 310).</p>

<p class="p-left">SKINNER, RICHARD. Interluders, 1547–58.</p>

<p class="p-left">SLATER (SLAUGHTER), MARTIN. Admiral’s, 1594–7; Scotland, 1599;
Hertford’s, 1603; Anne’s, 1606; King’s Revels manager, 1608; Chamber
of Bristol, 1618–19. He is sometimes recorded by his Christian name
only. He had a wife on 22 July 1604, and is described as a citizen and
ironmonger in 1608. His name is in the Southwark token-books from 1595
to 1602, and Martin Slawter, ‘a servant’, was buried there on 4 August
1625 (H. ii. 310; <i>Bodl.</i>).</p>

<p class="p-left">SLAUGHTER, WILLIAM. ‘Ghost-name’ evolved by Mr. Fleay for a supposed
Queen’s man.</p>

<p class="p-left">SLEE (SLYE), JOHN. Queen Jane’s, &gt;1537; Interluders, 1539–40.</p>

<p class="p-left">SLY, WILLIAM, was doubtless of Strange’s men or the Admiral’s about
1590–1, when he played in <i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i>. On 11 October
1594 Henslowe sold him ‘a jewell of gowld seat with a whitte safer’ for
8<i>s.</i> to be paid for at the rate of 1<i>s.</i> weekly.<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> But
apparently he never paid more than 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> An inventory
of garments belonging to the Admiral’s men on 13 March 1598 includes
‘Perowes sewt, which W<sup>m</sup> Sley were’.<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> Presumably this had come from
Strange’s men, as Sly is never traceable as a member of the Admiral’s
company. Probably he joined the Chamberlain’s men on their formation
in 1594. He is in all the lists of this company from 1598 to 1605, and
in the Induction to <i>The Malcontent</i> (1604). He is also in the
actor-list of the First Folio Shakespeare. The fact that ‘Christopher
Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton Heath’ is the name given to the beggar in
<i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> (<i>c.</i> 1594), led Collier to suggest
that he migrated from Warwickshire about the same time as Shakespeare.
But the beggar in <i>A Shrew</i> is already Sly, and the name occurs in
various parts of London. The Southwark token-books show a William Sly
in Norman’s Rents during 1588, in Horseshoe Court during 1593, and in
Rose Alley during 1595 and 1596.<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> In 1605 he was named as one of
the overseers and residuary executors, with a legacy, in the will of
Augustine Phillips. The register of St. Giles’s, Cripplegate, records
the baptism on 24 September and the burial on 4 October 1606 of John,
base-born son of William Sly, player, by Margaret Chambers; and the
register of St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, records his own burial on 16
August 1608, from Halliwell Street. His nuncupative will was made on 4
August 1608. He left legacies to Cuthbert Burbadge, and James Sandes,
and the rest of his property to Robert and Cecily Browne and their
daughter Jane. Robert is to have his part of the Globe, and Cecily
is appointed executrix. The will was witnessed by several illiterate
women, and disputed by a relative named William Sly, but proved on
24 August.<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> He was not one of the original shareholders in the
Globe, but was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span> admitted to a share in 1605 or later. On 9 August 1608,
between the date of his will and that of his death, he was granted a
lease of a seventh share in the Blackfriars, and this his executrix
afterwards surrendered to Richard Burbadge.<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> Heywood names Sly
(<i>c.</i> 1608) amongst other dead players, whose ‘deserts’ he

<p class="p-left">TARLTON, RICHARD, first appears in the ‘Q<sup>d</sup> Richard Tarlton’ at the
end of a ballad called <i>A very lamentable and wofull discours of the
fierce fluds ... the 5. of October, 1570</i> (Arber, i. 440).<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>
This is preserved (Halliwell, 126; Collier, <i>Old Ballads</i>, 78;
H. L. Collman, <i>Ballads and Broadsides</i>, 265). The Stationers’
Registers also record in 1576 ‘a newe booke in Englishe verse intituled
Tarltons Toyes’ (Arber, ii. 306), in 1578 ‘Tarltons Tragical Treatises
conteyninge sundrie discourses and pretie conceiptes bothe in prose
and verse’ (Arber, ii. 323), and in 1579 ‘Tarltons devise upon this
unlooked for great snowe’ (Arber, ii. 346); but these are all lost.
<i>Tarltons Jigge of a horse loade of Fooles</i> (Halliwell, xx)
should, if it is genuine, date from about 1579, as the jest at the
Puritan fool ‘Goose son’ is obviously aimed at Stephen Gosson; but
it reads to me like a fake, and Halliwell took it from a manuscript
belonging to Collier, who had already quoted it in his tainted <i>New
Facts</i>, 18. It is improbable that Richard is the ‘one Tarlton’ whose
house in Paris Garden is included in a list of suspected papist resorts
sent by Richard Frith to Alderman Martin at some date not earlier than
1585 (Wright, <i>Eliz.</i> ii. 250). The first mention of him is by
Gabriel Harvey (cf. p. 4) in 1579, when he had already acquired some
reputation. He became an original member of the Queen’s men (q. v.) in
1583, and remained their principal comedian until his death in 1588.
For this company he wrote <i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i> (q. v.) in 1585.
Music for some of his jigs is in existence (Halliwell, <i>Cambridge
Manuscript Rarities</i>, 8) and his facility as a jester made him,
until he pushed it too far, a <i>persona grata</i> in Elizabeth’s
presence. Bohun, 352, says that the Queen admitted ‘Tarleton, a famous
comedian, and a pleasant talker, and other such like men, to divert
her with stories of the town and the common jests or accidents, but
so that they kept within the bounds of modesty and chastity’. He
adds, ‘Tarleton, who was then the best comedian in England, had made
a pleasant play, and when it was acting before the Queen, he pointed
at Sir Walter Raleigh and said “See, the Knave commands the Queen”,
for which he was corrected by a frown from the Queen; yet he had the
confidence to add that he was of too much and too intolerable a power;
and going on with the same liberty, he reflected on the overgreat
power and riches of the Earl of Leicester, which was so universally
applauded by all that were present, that she thought best to bear
these reflections with a seeming unconcernedness. But yet she was so
offended, that she forbad Tarleton and all her jesters from coming
near her table, being inwardly displeased with this impudent and
unseasonable liberty.’ An anecdote of Tarlton ‘playing the God Luz
with a flitch of bacon at his back’, fighting the Queen’s little dog
Perrico de Faldes with sword and long staff, and exchanging chaff with
the Earl of Sussex (Halliwell, <i>Death-bed</i>, 30, from <i>S. P.
Dom. Eliz.</i> ccxv, 89) might have some point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span> if Luz was a take-off
of Leicester. On 27 October 1587 Tarlton was allowed as a Master of
Fence, and is described as an ‘ordenary grome off her majestes chamber’
(<i>Sloane MS.</i> 2530, f. 6). The same description recurs in his
will, which was signed on 3 September 1588, the actual day of his
burial at St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, from Halliwell Street. He left
his property to his son Philip, as whose guardians he appointed his
mother Katharine, then a widow, his friend Robert Adams, and his fellow
of the Queen’s men, William Johnson. One of the witnesses, Charles
Barnard, was his sister’s husband. This will was disputed by Katharine
Tarlton, who brought a bill in Chancery, alleging that after signing
it and making over property worth £700 to Adams, Tarlton repented,
tried in vain to recall the will, and made another. A rejoinder by
Adams accuses Katharine of acting under the influence of another
son-in-law, Thomas Lee, a butcher, and describes how Adams was called
to Tarlton’s death-bed in the house of one Emma Ball in Shoreditch,
‘of a very bad reputacion’. Some colour is given to his mother’s
complaint by a death-bed petition from Tarlton to Walsingham, begging
his protection for Philip, who was Sidney’s godson, against ‘a sly
fellow, on Addames’ (<i>S. P. Dom. Eliz.</i> ccxv. 90). There is no
mention of Tarlton’s wife; the boy was six years old. Robert Adams was
apparently a lawyer, and to be distinguished from John Adams of the
Queen’s men, who is referred to as a fellow of Tarlton’s by the stage
keeper in <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> (Induction 38), ‘I kept the Stage in
Master <i>Tarletons</i> time, I thanke my starres. Ho! and that man
had liu’d to haue play’d in <i>Bartholmew Fayre</i>, you should ha’
seene him ha’ come in, and ha’ beene coozened i’ the Cloath-quarter, so
finely. And <i>Adams</i>, the Rogue, ha’ leap’d and caper’d vpon him,
and ha’ dealt his vermine about, as though they had cost him nothing.’
After Tarlton’s death, several pamphlets, ascribed to him or otherwise
exploiting his popularity, came to the press; in 1588 ‘a ballad
intituled Tarltons Farewell’ (Arber, ii. 500); in 1589 ‘a sorowfull
newe sonnette, intituled Tarltons Recantacon uppon this theame gyven
him by a gentleman at the Bel savage without Ludgate (nowe or ells
never) beinge the laste theame he songe’ (Arber, ii. 526); in 1589
‘Tarltons repentance of his farewell to his frendes in his sicknes a
little before his deathe’ (Arber, ii. 531); in 1590 ‘a pleasant dyttye
dialogue wise betwene Tarltons ghost and Robyn Good Fellowe’ (Arber,
ii. 559). These are lost, unless, indeed, <i>Tarltons Farewell</i>
is identical with ‘A pretie new ballad, entituled Willie and Peggie,
to the tune of Tarlton’s Carroll’, printed in <i>Archiv.</i> cxiv.
341, and A. Clark, <i>Shirburn Ballads</i>, 351, from <i>Rawl. Poet.
MS.</i> 185, f. 10. This ends ‘qd. Richard Tarlton’, but it is in fact
a lament over the death of Tarlton under the name of Willie, as is
clearly shown by lines 23 ‘None would be wery to see him one stage’,
41 ‘A groome of her chamber my Willie was made’, 55 ‘To singe them
their themes he never denied’. These verses support the theory, based
upon a contemporary note in a copy of Spenser (cf. <i>6 N. Q.</i> xi.
417; Halliwell-Phillipps, ii. 394), that Tarlton is the ‘pleasant
Willy’ mourned as dead in the <i>Tears of the Muses</i> (1591), 208,
and if he is also the Yorick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span> of <i>Hamlet</i>, v. 1. 201, he was
sufficiently honoured. Another ballad in the same manuscript on the
Armada (<i>Archiv.</i> cxiv. 344; <i>Ballads from MS.</i> ii. 92)
also claims to be to the tune of Tarlton’s ‘carroll’; the ‘Carroll’
itself is unknown. ‘<i>Tarltons Newes out of Purgatorie. Onelye such
a jest as his Jigge, fit for Gentlemen to laugh at an houre, &amp;c.
Published by an old companion of his, Robin Goodfellow</i>’ (n.d.,
but entered in S. R. 26 June 1590; Arber, ii. 553) is a volume of
<i>novelle</i>, put into the mouth of Tarlton’s ghost. The writer
describes him as ‘only superficially seene in learning, having no
more but a bare insight into the Latin tung’, and physically as ‘one
attired in russet, with a buttond cap on his head, a great bag by his
side, and a strong bat in his hand’. Similarly, Henry Chettle, who put
into his mouth a defence of plays forming a section of <i>Kind-hartes
Dreame</i> (1592; cf. App. C, No. xlix), knew him in a dream ‘by his
sute of russet, his buttond cap, his taber, his standing on the toe,
and other tricks’. <i>The Cobler of Caunterburie or an Invective
against Tarltons Newes out of Purgatorie</i> (1590) is also a volume
of <i>novelle</i>, and has practically nothing about Tarlton. On the
other hand, <i>Tarltons Jests</i> at least claims to be biographical,
although its material, like that of Peele’s <i>Jests</i>, largely
consists of the flotsam and jetsam of all the jest-books. The earliest
extant edition is of 1611. But it was transferred from one publisher
to another in 1609 (Arber, iii. 402), the second of its three parts,
which mentions the Globe (Halliwell, 23), was entered in S. R. on 4
August 1600 (Arber, iii. 168), and probably therefore the first part
was already in print in the sixteenth century. It speaks of Tarlton
as a Queen’s man (Halliwell, 13, 27, 29, 30, 33), as playing at the
Bull in Bishopsgate (13, 24), where he did both the clown and the
judge in ‘Henry the Fifth’ (<i>The Famous Victories</i>) to Knell’s
Harry, the Curtain (16), and the Bell in Gracechurch Street (24), as
singing themes (16, 27, 28, 40), and as jesting in clown’s apparel in
the royal presence or in the Great Chamber at Court (7, 8). It also
tells us, for what the statements are worth, that his father lived
at Ilford (40), that he had a wife Kate of light character (17, 19),
that he kept the Saba tavern in Gracechurch Street, where he was
scavenger of the ward (15, 21, 22), and an ordinary in Paternoster
Row (21, 26), and that he had a squint (12) and a flat nose (28). A
woodcut on the title-page confirms these peculiarities of feature,
and represents a short, broad-faced, cunning-looking man, with curly
hair, an elaborate moustache and a starved beard, wearing a cap, and
a bag or moneybox slung at his side, and playing on a tabor and a
pipe. This appears to be taken from a drawing by John Scottowe in an
initial letter to some verses on Tarlton’s death in <i>Harl. MS.</i>
3885, f. 19. Nashe, <i>Pierce Penilesse</i> (1592, <i>Works</i>, i.
188), gives us a hint of his stage methods in describing how at a
provincial performance, as the Queen’s men ‘were now entring into
their first merriment (as they call it) the people began exceedingly
to laugh, when <i>Tarlton</i> first peeped out his head’, and how a
‘cholericke wise Iustice’ laid his staff about their pates, ‘in that
they, being but Farmers &amp; poore countrey Hyndes, would presume to
laugh at the Queenes men, and make no more account of her cloath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
in his presence’. According to Fuller (<i>Worthies</i>, iii. 139)
Tarlton was born at Condover in Shropshire, and kept his father’s swine
there, until a servant of the Earl of Leicester, struck with his witty
replies, brought him to Court. On the other hand, in the <i>Three Lords
and Three Ladies of London</i> (1590), by his fellow Robert Wilson,
Simplicity produces his picture, and says he was ‘a prentice in his
youth of this honorable city: ... when he was yoong he was leaning to
the trade ... waterbearing: I wis he hath tossed a tankard in Cornehil
er now’ (sign. <span class="allsmcap">C</span><sup>v</sup>). Halliwell (xxx) has collected a large
number of allusions to Tarleton and his humours, lasting well into
the middle of the seventeenth century. Taverns were named after him,
and one is said to have still stood in Southwark in 1798. Much of the
action of W. Percy’s <i>Cuck-Queanes and Cuckolds Errants</i> (q. v.)
takes place at the Tarlton Inn, Colchester, of which he is said to have
been the ‘quondam controller and induperator’. Tarlton himself speaks
the prologue to the play. George Wilson, <i>The Commendation of Cockes
and Cock-fighting</i> (1607), records that on 4 May 1602 there fought
at Norwich ‘a cocke called Tarleton, who was so intituled, because he
alwayes came to the fight like a drummer, making a thundering noyse
with his winges, which cocke fought many batels with mighty and fierce
adversaries’.</p>

<p class="p-left">TAYLOR, JOSEPH, is conjectured by Collier to be the Joseph Taylor
who was baptized at St. Andrew’s by the Wardrobe in Blackfriars on 6
February 1586, the Joseph Taylor who married Elizabeth Ingle, widow,
at St. Saviour’s, Southwark, on 2 May 1610, and the Joseph Taylor who
is shown by the Southwark token-books as dwelling in ‘M<sup>r</sup> Langley’s
new rents, near the play-house’ during 1607, in Austen’s Rents during
1612 and 1615, as ‘gone’ in 1617, and as dwelling ‘near the play-house’
in 1623 and 1629, ‘on the Bankside’ in 1631, and in Gravel Lane
during 1633. ‘Joseph Taylor, player,’ is entered in the St. Saviour’s
registers as the father of Elsabeth (bapt. 12 July 1612), Dixsye and
Joseph (bapt. 21 July 1614), Jone (bapt. 11 January 1616), Robert
(bapt. 1 June 1617), and Anne (bapt. 24 August 1623).<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> On the
other hand, a Joseph Taylor, not improbably a player, was living in
Bishopsgate near the Spittle in 1623 (J. 347). He was a member of the
Duke of York’s company in 1610, but left them without the consent of
his fellows for the Lady Elizabeth’s in 1611, and thereby involved
himself during the same year in a lawsuit with John Heminges.<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> He
is in the actor-lists of <i>The Honest Man’s Fortune</i> (1613) and
of <i>The Coxcomb</i>, as played by the Lady Elizabeth’s men about
the same date, and is also named in the text of their <i>Bartholomew
Fair</i> (1614). There seems to have been some sort of amalgamation
between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span> Duke of York’s, now Prince Charles’s, and the Lady
Elizabeth’s in 1615, and when this terminated in the following year,
Taylor became again a member of the Prince’s company. He was still with
them between 6 January and 2 February 1619, when he appeared as Dr.
Almanac in Middleton and Rowley’s <i>Mask of Heroes</i>, but on 19 May
1619 he appears in a livery warrant issued for the King’s men. As he is
not in their patent of the previous 27 March, it is to be supposed that
he joined them to replace Burbadge, who had died on 13 March.<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>
The rest of his stage career was spent with the King’s men. He
succeeded Burbadge in several of his characters, including Ferdinand
in the <i>Duchess of Malfi</i> and Hamlet, although the incidence of
dates must cast some doubt upon the statement of Downes that he was
instructed in the part ‘by the Author M<sup>r</sup> Shakespear’.<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> Wright
says that he played it ‘incomparably well’, and praises him also
as Iago in <i>Othello</i>, Truewit in <i>Epicoene</i>, and Face in
<i>The Alchemist</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> He is included in the First Folio list of
performers in Shakespeare’s plays. In 1623 Nicholas Tooley left him
£10 to pay a debt for which Tooley had become his surety. With Lowin
he seems to have assumed the leadership of the company in succession
to Heminges and Condell, and after Heminges’s death in 1630 he was
admitted to two shares in the ‘house’ of the Globe and one in that of
the Blackfriars, which he still held in 1635. About 1637 he petitioned
for a waiter’s place in the Custom House of London,<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> and on 11
November 1639 he obtained the post of Yeoman of the Revels, probably
through the influence of Sir Henry Herbert, with whom he had been
in frequent contact as representative of his company.<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> After
the closing of the theatres he joined his fellows of the King’s men
in publishing the First Folio of Beaumont and Fletcher’s plays in
1647, and for his benefit and Lowin’s <i>The Wild-goose Chase</i> was
added in 1652. He died at Richmond and was there buried on 4 November

<p class="p-left">TOOLEY, NICHOLAS, appears in the 1619 patent to the King’s men, but
not in that of 1603. He probably joined the company about 1605, as he
received a legacy under the will of Phillips on 4 May as his ‘fellow’.
He is not in the actor-list of <i>Volpone</i> in that year, but is
in most of the later actor-lists from <i>The Alchemist</i> (1610)
to <i>The Spanish Curate</i> (1622), and in that of the First Folio
Shakespeare. In 1619 he witnessed Richard Burbadge’s will. He made
his own will as Nicholas Tooley, Gentleman, on 3 June 1623. After
legacies to charity, to the families of ‘my good friend Mr. Cuthbert
Burbadge (in whose house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span> I do now lodge)’, of ‘my late Mr. Richard
Burbadge deceased’, and of ‘my good friend Mr. Henry Condell’, and to
Joseph Taylor, and remissions of debt to John Underwood and William
Ecclestone, but not to Richard Robinson, he ends by making Burbadge
and Condell his executors and residuary legatees. By a codicil of the
same date, signed as Nicholas Wilkinson <i>alias</i> Tooley, he guards
against any danger of invalidity due to his failure to use the name
of Wilkinson.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> Presumably, therefore, Wilkinson, and not Tooley,
was his original name. The name of Tooley was fairly common in London,
and more than one Nicholas Wilkinson has been traced. He may have
been the Nicholas, son of Charles Wilkinson, baptized at St. Anne’s,
Blackfriars, on 3 February 1575.<a href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> There seems no reason to connect
him with a Nicholas Tooley found on the Warwickshire muster-book in
1569.<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> His reference to Richard Burbadge as
his ‘master’ suggests that he was his apprentice. It is tempting, but
arbitrary, to identify him with the ‘Nick’ who played with Strange’s
men in <i>2 Seven Deadly Sins</i> about 1592, or the ‘Nycke’ who
tumbled before Elizabeth for the Admiral’s in 1601 and is commended
by Joan to Edward Alleyn on 21 October 1603.<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> The register of

Towne’s name is in the Southwark token-books during 1600–7, and Thomas
Towne ‘a man’ was buried on 9 August 1612. Towne’s will of 4 July 1612

Blackfriars until, as the <i>Sharers Papers</i> state, on growing up
to be a man, he was taken to strengthen the King’s service. This was
in 1608 or a little later. He is not in the Queen’s Revels actor-list
of <i>Epicoene</i> (1609), and is in the King’s men’s actor-list of
<i>The Alchemist</i> (1610), and thereafter in the official lists and
most of the actor-lists of the company, including that of the First
Folio Shakespeare, up to 1624. Tooley in his will of 1623 forgave him
a debt. His own will was made on 4 October 1624 and has a codicil
appended on 10 October, doubtless from his oral directions, but after
his death. He describes himself as ‘of the parish of Saint Bartholomew
the Less, in London, gent.’, and leaves his shares in the Blackfriars,
Globe, and Curtain to his executors, of whom Henry Condell is one, in
trust for his five children, all under twenty-one&mdash;John, Elizabeth,
Burbage, Thomas, and Isabel. The executors and his ‘fellowes’, Mr. John
Heminges and John Lowin, who are appointed overseers, have 11s. each
for rings.<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> The baptism of his son John on 27 December 1610 is in

trust was still unexpired at Condell’s death in 1627, and was handed on
by him to his wife. The <i>Sharers Papers</i> of 1635 show one share in
the Blackfriars still in the hands of an Underwood; but apparently a
third of it had been parted with about 1632 to Eliart Swanston.<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">WILSON, JOHN. In <i>Much Ado</i>, ii. 3. 38, for the ‘Enter Balthaser
with musicke’ of Q<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>1</sub> has ‘Enter ... Iacke Wilson’, who
therefore, at some date before 1623, sang ‘Sigh no more, ladies!’
He is probably the son of Nicholas Wilson, ‘minstrel’, baptized at
St. Bartholomew’s the Less on 24 April 1585. He had an elder brother
Adam, and buried a wife Joan on 17 July 1624, and an unnamed son on
3 September 1624 at St. Giles’s from the house of George Sommerset,
musician (Collier, <i>Actors</i>, xviii). He seems to have become a
city ‘wait’ about 1622 and to have still held his post in 1641, and
has been confused (Collier in <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>, ii. 33; E. F.
Rimbault, <i>Who was Jacke Wilson?</i>, 1846) with another John Wilson,
born in 1595, a royal lutenist and musician of distinction (cf. <i>D.
N. B.</i>). One or other of them was concerned with a performance of
<i>M. N. D.</i> in the house of John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, on 27
September 1631, which gave offence to the Puritans (Murray, ii. 148).</p>

<p class="p-left">WILSON, ROBERT, was one of Leicester’s men in 1572, 1574, and 1581.
A reference in Gabriel Harvey’s correspondence of 1579 suggests that
he was conspicuous amongst the actors of the day, and Lodge’s praise
about the same date in the <i>Defence of Plays</i> of his <i>Shorte and
Sweete</i>, ‘the practice of a good scholler,’ shows that he was also
a playwright. This piece Lodge compares with Gosson’s <i>Catiline’s
Conspiracies</i>, and it may have been on the same theme. Further
evidence of his reputation is in the letter of 1581 from T. Baylye (q.
v.). In 1583 he joined the Queen’s men, and is described by Howes in
his account of the formation of that company as a ‘rare’ man ‘for a
quicke, delicate, refined, extemporall witt’. He is not in the Queen’s
list of 1588. This may not be quite complete; on the other hand he
may by then have left the company. I see no solid foundation for the
conjectures of Fleay, ii. 279, that he was the player of <i>Greenes
Groatsworth of Wit</i> (cf. App. C, No. xlviii) who penned the
<i>Moral of Man’s Wit</i> and the <i>Dialogue of Dives</i>, that he
wrote <i>Fair Em</i>, that he left the Queen’s for Strange’s in 1590
and thereby incurred Greene’s hostility, that he is the Roscius of
Nashe’s <i>Menaphon</i> epistle, that he died of the plague in 1593.
It is extremely unlikely that he died in 1593, for in his <i>Palladis
Tamia</i> of 1598, after lauding Tarlton as famous for ‘extemporall
verse’, Meres continues, ‘And so is now our wittie Wilson, who for
learning and extemporall witte in this facultie is without compare or
compeere, as to his great and eternall commendations he manifested
in his chalenge at the Swanne on the Banke side.’ The common use by
Meres and Howes of the phrase ‘extemporall witte’ renders it almost
impossible to suppose that they are not speaking of the same man. It is
true that, in the <i>Apology for Actors</i>, Heywood, whose knowledge
of the stage must have gone back at least to 1594, classes Wilson with
the older generation of actors, whom he never saw, as being before his
time, and I take it the explanation is that, at or before the virtual
break-up of the Queen’s men in the plague of 1592–3, Wilson gave up
acting, and devoted himself to writing, and occasional extemporizing on
themes. He is generally supposed to be the R. W. of <i>The Three Ladies
of London</i> (1584) and <i>The Three Lords of London</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span> (1590), and
the ‘Robert Wilson, Gent.’ of <i>The Cobbler’s Prophecy</i> (1594).
The ‘Gent.’ is hardly an insuperable obstacle to identifying him with
the ‘Robert Wilson, yoman (a player)’, who was buried at St. Giles’s,
Cripplegate, on 20 November 1600 (Collier, <i>Actors</i>, xviii). A
Wilson is in the suspected Admiral’s cast of <i>c.</i> January 1600.
But now comes the real difficulty. Meres, also in the <i>Palladis
Tamia</i> and without any indication that he has another man in mind,
includes ‘Wilson’ in a group of ‘the best for comedy amongst vs’, which
is composed of the principal writers for the Admiral’s in 1598, and
amongst these writers, as shown by Henslowe’s papers, was a Robert
Wilson, who collaborated in eleven plays during 1598, and in three
more during 1599 and 1600. He is last mentioned in a letter of 14 June
1600. This is generally taken to be a younger man than the Queen’s
player, possibly a Robert Wilson who was baptized at St. Botolph’s,
Bishopsgate, on 22 September 1579, and married Mary Eaton there on 24
June 1606, possibly the Robert Wilson (not described as ‘a player and
the younger’ as Collier suggests in <i>Bodl.</i>) whose son Robert was
baptized at St. Leonard’s on 15 January 1601 (Stopes, <i>Burbage</i>,
141), possibly the Robert Wilson whose burial is recorded at St.
Bartholomew’s the Less on 21 October 1610. On the whole, I am inclined
to think that, in view of the character of Meres’ references, of the
use of Catiline as a play-theme both about 1580 and in 1598 (cf. ch.
xxiii), and of the sudden disappearance of Wilson from Henslowe’s diary
in the year of the ‘player’s’ death, the balance of evidence is in
favour of one playwright rather than two. The undefined share of the
Admiral’s man in the extant <i>1 Sir John Oldcastle</i> does not really
afford a basis for stylistic comparison with the more old-fashioned
manners of the 1584–94 plays. There is nothing to show that the
Bishopsgate man had any connexion with the stage, still less that he
was a son of the Queen’s player, as has been suggested.</p>

INTRODUCTION: THE PUBLIC THEATRES</h3>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;Some notes in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> for 1813–16 by Eu. Hood [Joseph Haslewood] are
reprinted in <i>The Gentleman’s Magazine Library</i>, xv (1904),
86, and in <i>Roxburghe Revels</i> (ed. J. Maidment, 1837). J.
P. Collier, <i>History of English Dramatic Poetry</i>, iii.
79, has <i>An Account of the Old Theatres of London</i>, and
chronological sections on the subject are in F. G. Fleay, <i>A
Chronicle History of the London Stage</i> (1890). T. F. Ordish,
<i>Early London Theatres</i> (1894), covers the Shoreditch
and Bankside theatres ‘in the Fields’ other than the Globe;
a companion volume on the urban houses has never appeared.
The Bankside houses are also dealt with by W. Rendle, <i>The
Bankside, Southwark, and the Globe</i> (1877), being Appendix I
to F. J. Furnivall, <i>Harrison’s Description of England</i>,
Part II (<i>N. Sh. Soc.</i>), and in <i>Old Southwark and
its People</i> (1878) and <i>The Play-houses at Bankside in
the Time of Shakespeare</i> (<i>Walford’s Antiquarian</i>,
1885, vii. 207, 274; viii. 55). J. Q. Adams, <i>Shakespearean
Play-houses</i> (1917), is a comprehensive and valuable work,
which reached me when this chapter was practically complete. I
am glad to find that our results so generally agree. The chief
London maps have been reproduced by the <i>London Topographical
Society</i> and on a smaller scale by G. E. Mitton, <i>Maps of
Old London</i> (1908). Some are also given as illustrations
in G. P. Baker, <i>The Development of Shakespeare as a
Dramatist</i> (1907). They are classified by W. Martin, <i>A
Study of Early Map-Views of London</i> in <i>The Antiquary</i>,
xlv (1909), 337, 406, and their evidence for the Bankside
analysed by the same writer, with partial reproductions, in
<i>The Site of the Globe Play-house of Shakespeare</i> (1910,
<i>Surrey Archaeological Collections</i>, xxiii. 149).</p>

<p>The evidence of the maps as to the position of the theatres
is obscured, partly by uncertainties as to the dates and
authorships both of the engravings and of the surveys on which
they were based, and partly by the pictorial character of the
topography. They are not strict plans in two dimensions, such
as modern cartographers produce, but either drawings in full
perspective, or bird’s-eye views in diminished perspective.
The imaginary standpoint is always on the south, and the
pictorial aspect is emphasized in the foreground, with the
result that, while the Bankside theatres, but not those north
of the river, are generally indicated, this is rarely with a
precision which renders it possible to locate them in relation
to the thoroughfares amongst which they stand. This is more
particularly the case since, while the general grouping of
buildings, gardens, and trees appears, from a comparison of one
view with another, to be faithfully given, it is probable that
the details are often both conventionally represented and out
of scale. The following classification is mainly borrowed from
Dr. Martin: (<i>a</i>) Pre-Reformation representations of London
throwing no light on the theatres; (<i>b</i>) <i>Wyngaerde</i>,
a pictorial drawing (<i>c.</i> 1543–50) by A. Van der Wyngaerde
(<i>L. T. Soc.</i> i; Mitton, i); (<i>c</i>) <i>Höfnagel</i>, a
plan with little perspective by G. Höfnagel, from a survey of
<i>c.</i> 1554–7 (cf. A. Marks in <i>Athenaeum</i> for 31 March
1906), published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> (1572) with the title <i>Londinum Feracissimi
Angliae Regni Metropolis</i> in G. Braun and F. Hohenburg,
<i>Civitates Orbis Terrarum</i> (L. T. Soc. ii; Mitton, iv);
(<i>d</i>) <i>Agas</i>, an engraving with more perspective,
but generally similar to that of Höfnagel and possibly from
the same survey, but drawn after 1561, and assigned by G.
Vertue, who reproduced it (1737), to Ralph Agas (L. T. Soc.
xvii; Mitton, ii); (<i>e</i>) <i>Smith</i>, a coloured drawing
by William Smith, possibly based on Höfnagel or Agas, in <i>B.
M. Sloane MS.</i> 2596, reproduced in H. B. Wheatley and E.
W. Ashbee, <i>W. Smith</i>, <i>The Particular Description of
England, 1588</i> (1879), and in G. P. Baker, <i>The Development
of Shakespeare as a Dramatist</i> (1907), 18; (<i>f</i>)
<i>Bankside Views</i>, small representations of the same
general character as (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>), and (<i>e</i>),
used as backgrounds to pictures and described by W. Martin in

in slight perspective of ‘London’ and ‘Westminster’ by P. Van
den Keere in J. Norden, <i>Speculum Britanniae</i> (1593), from
survey of about the same date (L. T. Soc. vii; Mitton, v, vi;

based on some original of <i>c.</i> 1603; (<i>i</i>) <i>Hondius

<h4>A. INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>The detailed notices, which will form the greater part of this chapter,
may with advantage be prefaced with some general observations upon
the historical sequence of the theatres and their distribution at
different periods over the London area. The earlier Tudor London
knew no theatre, in the sense of a building specially planned and
maintained for public dramatic performances, although Yarmouth had its
‘game-house’ by 1538, and a <i>theatrum</i> at Exeter was the scene
of satirical farces far back in the fourteenth century. The miracle
plays, not in London processional, were given in the open air, and
probably on temporary scaffolds. Similar stages may sometimes have
been used for the interludes, but these were ordinarily represented
in the winter-time, and sought the kindly shelter of a hall.<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> In
the provision of specialized buildings, the drama appears to have been
anticipated by the ruder sport of baiting. Höfnagel’s pre-Elizabethan
map already shows on the Southwark side of the river the two rings,
with open centres and roofed seats for spectators, which are repeated
later on by Agas and by Smith. They stand in yards or gardens lined
with dog-kennels. One is lettered ‘The Bowll bayting’, the other
‘The beare bayting’. When the first Elizabethan theatres were built
in 1576, it was the hall on the one hand, and the ring on the other,
which determined the general structure of the two types of auditorium
that came simultaneously into being.<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> The ‘private’ house, roofed
and lit, and with its seats arranged in tiers along three sides of a
long room, and the ‘public’ house, generally circular, with covered
stage and galleries, and a central yard or ‘pit’ open to the day,
co-existed for more than half a century, and finally merged in the
post-Restoration type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span> of theatre which has come down to our own day.
The distinction between ‘private’ and ‘public’ is an unessential one,
depending probably upon some difference in the methods of paying for
admission necessitated by the regulations of the City or the Privy
Council.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> The performances in all the houses were public in the
ordinary sense. There was, however, another important factor, besides
the baiting ring, which greatly affected the structure of the open-air
theatre. This was the inn-yard. Long before 1576, interludes had been
given in public, as well as in the private halls of the great, and even
the need for some kind of permanent, or quasi-permanent, installation
had been felt. No doubt there were halls in London which could be
hired. The keeper of the Carpenters’ Hall in Shoreditch was prosecuted
towards the end of Henry VIII’s reign for procuring a Protestant
interlude ‘to be openly played’.<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> Fees for the letting of Trinity
Hall for plays occur among the ‘casuall recepts’ of the churchwardens
of St. Botolph without Aldersgate in 1566–7.<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> A jest-book of
1567 records a play at Northumberland Place.<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> But an even more
convenient hospitality was afforded by the great court-yards of the
City inns, where there was sack and bottle-ale to hand, and, as the
Puritans averred, chambers ready for deeds of darkness to be done, when
the play was over.<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> In these yards, approached by archways under
the inn buildings from one or more streets, and surrounded by galleries
with external staircases giving access to the upper floors, an audience
could quickly gather, behold at their ease, and escape payment with
difficulty. The actors could be accommodated with a tiring-room on the
ground floor, and perform as on a natural stage between the pillars
supporting the galleries. An upper gallery could be used to vary the
scene. The first performances in London inns upon record were at the
Saracen’s Head, Islington, and the Boar’s Head, Aldgate, both in
1557.<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> By the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign the use of them was
normal. Plays ‘in hostels and taverns’ were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span> specified for prohibition
by the proclamation of April 1559, and the City regulations of 1574 are
clearly aimed at the control of the ‘greate innes, havinge chambers
and secrete places adjoyninge to their open stagies and gallyries’,
and impose obligations for the sake of good order upon innkeepers
and tavern-keepers in the forefront of those regarded as likely to
harbour plays.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> It is not reading too much between the lines to
suggest that the owners of particular houses specially laid themselves
out to secure the attraction of public entertainments, entered into
regular contracts with players, and probably even undertook structural
alterations which in fact converted their yards into little less
than permanent theatres.<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> We have, indeed, the record of a
trade dispute about the workmanship of play-scaffolds at the Red
Lion in Stepney as far back as 1567. The Red Lion stood outside the
jurisdiction of the City. Within it, and so far as we can judge, much
more important in the history of the stage were the Bell and the Cross
Keys, both in Gracechurch Street, the Bull in Bishopsgate Street,
and the Bel Savage on Ludgate Hill. No one of these four is in fact
mentioned by name as a play-house earlier than 1575, and although they
must have been hard hit by the regulations of 1574, it is clear that
they did not go altogether out of use, especially during the winter,
when climatic conditions rendered the suburbs unattractive, for another
twenty years. Stockwood, in 1578, speaks of six or eight ‘ordinarie
places’ where plays were then performed.<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> Nevertheless the action
of the City, and the enterprise of James Burbadge, whose descendants
claimed for him the honour of being ‘the first builder of playhowses’,
led to a shifting of the dramatic focus. The Theatre and the Curtain,
both built in or about 1576, stood in ‘the fields’ to the north of
London proper, and were perhaps soon followed by Newington Butts on
the south side of the river, beyond St. George’s Fields; while the
Blackfriars, adapted in the same year (1576) by Richard Farrant to
house the performances of children, occupied an old monastic building
in the precinct of a ‘liberty’ which, although within the walls, was
largely exempt from the jurisdiction of the Corporation. This became
the home of the Children of the Chapel, while the Paul’s boys played
in their own ‘song-school’, either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span> the church of St. Gregory or some
other building in the neighbourhood of St. Paul’s. How long this
arrangement had existed, or whether any company of children had played
in public at all before the date of Farrant’s experiment, we do not
know. From 1576 onwards, it is the Theatre and the Curtain which have
to bear the brunt of the Puritan attack, and the luxury of these, as
compared with the primitive accommodation of the inn-yards, arouses
a special indignation. ‘The sumptuous Theatre houses, a continual
monument of Londons prodigalitie and folly’, wails Thomas White in
1577. Stockwood in 1578 discommends ‘the gorgeous playing place erected
in the fieldes’; and William Harrison, perhaps about the same time,
finds it ‘an evident token of a wicked time when plaiers wexe so riche
that they can build such houses’.<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> Presently the theatres became
notable amongst the sights which foreign travellers must see in London.
Lupold von Wedel in 1584 says nothing of them, although he records the
baiting and its rings.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> But they are noticed in the following year
by Samuel Kiechel, a merchant of Ulm, who writes:<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Comedies are given daily. It is particularly mirthful to
behold, when the Queen’s comedians act, but annoying to a
foreigner who does not know the language, that he understands
nothing. There are some peculiar houses, which are so made as to
have about three galleries over one another, inasmuch as a great
number of people always enters to see such an entertainment. It
may well be that they take as much as from 50 to 60 dollars [£10
to £12] at once, especially when they act anything new, which
has not been given before, and double prices are charged. This
goes on nearly every day in the week; even though performances
are forbidden on Friday and Saturday, it is not observed.’</p>
</div>

<p>The Theatre and the London inns were still the chief playing-places,
when at some date between 1576 and 1596 William Lambarde illustrated
his account of the pilgrimages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span> to Boxley, by explaining that those who
visited the shrine did not get off scot-free&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘no more than such as goe to Parisgardein, the Bell Sauage, or
Theatre, to beholde Beare baiting, Enterludes, or Fence play,
can account of any pleasant spectacle, unlesse they first pay
one pennie at the gate, another at the entrie of the Scaffolde,
and the thirde for a quiet standing.’<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Paris Garden was the generic name given to the successive
places for bear-baiting which lay on the Surrey side of the river, not
in Southwark proper, which was in the jurisdiction of the City, but
in the Liberty of the Clink, which stretched in a westerly direction
along the Bankside, or still farther to the west, in the Manor of Paris
Garden itself. In Surrey, no less than in London, plays had established
themselves at an early date. A performance was going on in Southwark,
while the priests of St. Saviour’s sang <i>Dirige</i> for Henry VIII’s
soul in 1547.<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> The Privy Council ordered the Surrey justices to
suppress plays in the Borough and the adjoining places during 1578; and
it seems probable that a regular play-house had been built south of
the river at a date not much later than that of the Theatre itself. It
stood far back behind Southwark, in the village of Newington, divided
from the river by St. George’s Fields. The distance and the bad roads
were against it; and it was not until the Rose was built in the Clink
about 1587, that the Bankside became a serious rival to the ‘fields’
in the north as the home of theatres. The Swan, in Paris Garden, was
built in 1595. Newington is too far to the south to appear in the maps,
but Norden’s map of 1593 shows two round buildings, standing between
Bankside and an unnamed road, which may safely be identified with that
called Maiden Lane. One is lettered ‘The Beare howse’, the other, more
to the east and the south, ‘The play howse’; and this must clearly be
the Rose.</p>

<p>In 1596 the City appear to have at last obtained the assent of the
Privy Council to the complete exclusion of plays from the area of
their jurisdiction. This is probably the proceeding described, with
no precise indication of date, in the following passage from Richard
Rawlidge’s <i>A Monster Lately Found out and Discovered, or the
Scourging of Tipplers</i> (1628):<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<i>London</i> hath within the memory of man lost much of hir
pristine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span> lustre, ... by being ... filled with ... sinnes,
which ... are ... maintained, in Play-houses, Ale-houses,
Bawdy-houses, Dising-houses, ... All which houses, and traps
for Gentlemen, and others, of such Receipt, were formerly taken
notice of by many Citizens, and well disposed graue Gentlemen
... wherevpon some of the pious magistrates made humble suit
to the late Queene Elizabeth of ever-liuing memorie, and her
priuy Counsaile, and obteined leaue from her Majesty to thrust
those Players out of the Citty and to pull downe the Dicing
houses: which accordingly was affected, and the Play-houses
in <i>Gracious street</i>, <i>Bishops-gate-street</i>,
nigh <i>Paules</i>, that on <i>Ludgate</i> hill, the
<i>White-Friars</i> were put down, and other lewd houses quite
supprest within the Liberties, by the care of those religious
senators, ... and surely had all their successors followed
their worthy stepps, sinne would not at this day haue beene so
powerfull, and raigning as it is.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The play-houses in Gracious or Gracechurch Street, Bishopsgate Street,
and Ludgate Hill were presumably the Bell and the Cross Keys, the
Bull, and the Bel Savage. By the house ‘nigh Paul’s’ Rawlidge possibly
meant the choir song-school; but in fact there had been no plays by
the Paul’s boys since 1590. If there was really a Whitefriars house
at so early a date, this is the only notice preserved of it. It may
be suspected that Rawlidge confused it with the Blackfriars, which
James Burbadge was apparently prevented, upon representations by the
City, from reopening in 1596. The claim of the City to exercise any
control over the old religious precincts of the Blackfriars and the
Whitefriars was a doubtful one; and although they ultimately secured
jurisdiction, they were not able to prevent the so-called ‘private’
theatres from establishing themselves in these ‘liberties’.<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> With
these exceptions, however, and possibly that of the Boar’s Head, which
seems to have been used for a few years after 1602, but was more likely
just outside the bars, 1596 probably saw the last of playing within the
actual gates of the City.</p>

<p>Londoners had now to look wholly to the suburbs for their dramatic
entertainment. Prince Lewis of Anhalt-Cöthen found four theatres
in 1596.<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> These were doubtless the Theatre and the Curtain on
the north and the Rose and the Swan on the south of the river. The
Newington house was still used in 1594, but even before that had long
been out of fashion. It was probably also about 1596 that John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span> de
Witt wrote his <i>Observations Londinenses</i>. He too mentioned the
four theatres, together with the baiting house, and was particularly
struck by the newest, and as he avers, the largest and fairest of
them, the Swan, of the interior of which he attached a rough sketch to
his manuscript. This manuscript is lost, but fortunately an extract
survives, copied into a commonplace book by Arend van Buchell of
Utrecht. The following is the complete text:<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<p>The account of Paul Hentzner, who was in London from 31 August to
8 September 1598, lays less stress upon the theatres than upon the
baiting, and is not altogether consistent with that of de Witt as to
the structure of the Swan, which was the nearest house to the moorings
of the royal barge at the west end of Paris Garden.<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> Hentzner
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Sunt porro Londini extra Urbem Theatra aliquot, in quibus

</div>

<p>Hentzner then describes the baiting.<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> He concludes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Utuntur in hisce spectaculis sicut &amp; alibi, ubicunque locorum

</div>

<p class="p-left">It is perhaps natural that foreign visitors should be
more struck by the English theatres at a time when the English stage
was serving as a model to northern Europe, than was the case with a
native chronicler of grave and slightly Puritanic tendencies. John
Stowe, when he published his <i>Survey of London</i> in 1598, had
nothing to say of the Bankside houses, and but little of those in
Middlesex. After writing of the miracle plays, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Of late time in place of those Stage playes, hath beene vsed
Comedies, Tragedies, Enterludes, and Histories, both true and
fayned: For the acting whereof certaine publike places as the
Theater, the Curtine, &amp;c., haue been erected’ [<i>in margin</i>,
‘Theater and Curten for Comedies &amp; other shewes’].<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">In another place, at the end of a description of
Holywell, he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘And neare therevnto are builded two publique houses for the
acting and shewe of Comedies, Tragedies, and Histories, for
recreation. Whereof the one is called the Courtein, the other
the Theatre: both standing on the South-west side towards the
field.’<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Even these scanty references were pruned in the second
edition of 1603, after the Theatre had disappeared at the end of 1598
and the Chamberlain’s men had left the Curtain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span> And of the Globe,
built during the earlier half of 1599, to which they migrated, Stowe
takes no notice. The Globe, however, appears, although unnamed,
together with two other theatres, of which one must be the Curtain,
in the next foreign account, a very full one by Thomas Platter of
Basle, who was in England from 18 September to 20 October 1599.<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>
I translate the passage, of which sufficient use has not been made by
historians of the stage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘After dinner on the 21st of September, at about two o’clock,
I went with my companions over the water, and in the strewn
roof-house saw the tragedy of the first Emperor Julius with
at least fifteen characters very well acted. At the end of
the comedy they danced according to their custom with extreme
elegance. Two in men’s clothes and two in women’s gave this
performance, in wonderful combination with each other. On
another occasion, I also saw after dinner a comedy, not far from
our inn, in the suburb; if I remember right, in Bishopsgate.
Here they represented various nations, with whom on each
occasion an Englishman fought for his daughter, and overcame
them all except the German, who won the daughter in fight. He
then sat down with him, and gave him and his servant strong
drink, so that they both got drunk, and the servant threw his
shoe at his master’s head and they both fell asleep. Meanwhile
the Englishman went into the tent, robbed the German of his
gains, and thus he outwitted the German also. At the end they
danced very elegantly both in English and in Irish fashion.
And thus every day at two o’clock in the afternoon in the city
of London two and sometimes three comedies are performed,
at separate places, wherewith folk make merry together, and
whichever does best gets the greatest audience. The places are
so built, that they play on a raised platform, and every one
can well see it all. There are, however, separate galleries and
there one stands more comfortably and moreover can sit, but one
pays more for it. Thus anyone who remains on the level standing
pays only one English penny: but if he wants to sit, he is let
in at a further door, and there he gives another penny. If he
desires to sit on a cushion in the most comfortable place of
all, where he not only sees everything well, but can also be
seen, then he gives yet another English penny at another door.
And in the pauses of the comedy food and drink are carried round
amongst the people, and one can thus refresh himself at his own
cost.</p>

<p>‘The comedians are most expensively and elegantly apparelled,
since it is customary in England, when distinguished gentlemen
or knights die, for nearly the finest of their clothes to be
made over and given to their servants, and as it is not proper
for them to wear such clothes but only to imitate them, they
give them to the comedians to purchase for a small sum.</p>

<p>‘What they can thus produce daily by way of mirth in the
comedies, every one knows well, who has happened to see them
acting or playing.’</p>
</div>

<p>Platter then describes the Cockpit and the baiting. He concludes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘With such and many other pastimes besides the English spend
their time; in the comedies they learn what is going on in other
lands, and this happens without alarm, husband and wife together
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span> a familiar place, since for the most part the English do not
much use to travel, but are content ever to learn of foreign
matters at home, and ever to take their pastime.’</p>

<p class="p-left">A year later than Platter, another traveller thus
describes a visit to the Bankside:<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘1600 die Lunae 3 Julii. Audivimus comoediam Anglicam; theatrum
ad morem antiquorum Romanorum constructum ex lignis, ita
formatum ut omnibus ex partibus spectatores commodatissime
singula videre possint. In reditu transivimus pontem magnificis
aedificiis ornatum e quibus uni adhuc affixa cernuntur capita
quorundam comitum et nobilium, qui laesae Majestatis rei
supplicio affecti sunt.’</p>
</div>

<p>When Lewis of Anhalt and de Witt wrote, there were four theatres,
exclusive of the City inn-yards, which were probably already closed.
Platter found two, and sometimes three, performances being given daily.
This agrees with the evidence available from other sources. After the
scandal of <i>The Isle of Dogs</i> in 1597, the Privy Council decreed
a limitation of the London companies to two, the Chamberlain’s men and
the Admiral’s. The former played at the Curtain until 1599, when they
destroyed the Theatre and built the Globe. The latter played at the
Rose until 1600, when they migrated to the newly built Fortune. But
it is clear that the ordinance of the Privy Council was not strictly
observed. An intruding company was playing in February 1598, either
at the Theatre or the Swan. Platter’s three houses in 1599 included
the Curtain, together presumably with the Globe and the Rose. When the
Council sanctioned the opening of the Fortune in 1600, they understood
that the Curtain was to be ‘either ruinated or applied to some other
good use’, but it was still the scene of plays in 1601. Finally, in
the spring of 1602 Elizabeth ordered the Council to tolerate a third
company, that of the Earl of Worcester, Master of the Horse. This
was then playing at the Boar’s Head, a short-lived house of which
practically nothing is known; in the autumn it moved to the Rose. The
Swan possibly went out of use, except for the occasional performances
of acrobats and fencers, or of amateurs. On the other hand, Lord
Hertford’s men were in London during the winter of 1602–3, in addition
to the three privileged companies, and they must have practised
somewhere.</p>

<p>To the above must be added, for the closing years of Elizabeth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
reign, the ‘private’ houses; Paul’s reopened in the winter of 1599,
the Blackfriars in that of 1600. Of these Platter knows nothing, but
Duke Philip Julius of Stettin-Pomerania, in the autumn of 1602, in
addition to performances at the Fortune and another theatre, saw also,
doubtless at the Blackfriars, the <i>Kinder-comoedia</i>. The following
is an extract from the diary of the visit kept by the duke’s secretary,
Frederic Gerschow:<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘13 [September] On the thirteenth a comedy was played, of
the taking of Stuhl-Weissenberg, firstly by the Turks, and
thereafter back again by the Christians.</p>

<p>14. In the afternoon was played a tragicomedy of Samson and the
half tribe of Benjamin.’<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">On 16 September the duke and his retinue saw the baiting.
On 18 September they visited the Blackfriars, and Gerschow wrote an
account of the organization of the Children of the Chapel and of the
nature of their performances.<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

<p>The Globe and the Fortune continued in regular use, as the houses of
the King’s men, and the Prince’s men respectively, during the new
reign, and endured to the closing of the theatres in 1642. Each was
destroyed by fire and rebuilt; the former in 1613, the latter in 1621.
Queen Anne’s men at first used the Boar’s Head and the Curtain, but
migrated from the Boar’s Head to the Red Bull, which had been built by
1606. This became their principal house, and they cannot be shown to
have used the Curtain after 1609. These were the only companies of men
players in London during 1603–8, and the Globe, the Fortune, and the
Red Bull are obviously the ‘three houses’ whose rivalry is referred to
by Dekker in the following passage from his <i>Raven’s Almanack</i> of
1608:<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Another ciuill warre doe I finde wil fal betweene players, who
albeit at the beginning of this fatall yeare, they salute one
another like sworne brothers, yet before the middle of it, shall
they wish one anothers throate cut for two pence. The contention
of the two houses, (the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span> gods bee thanked) was appeased long
agoe, but a deadly warre betweene the three houses will I feare
burst out like thunder and lightning. For it is thought that
Flag will be aduanced (as it were in mortall defiance against
Flag), numbers of people will also bee mustred and fall to one
side or other, the drums and trumpets must be sounded, partes
will then (euen by the chiefest players) bee taken: words will
passe to and fro: speeches cannot so bee put vp, handes will
walke, an alarum be giuen, fortune must fauour some, or els they
are neuer able to stand: the whole world must sticke to others,
or else al the water in the theames wil not serue to carrie
those away that will bee put to flight, and a third faction must
fight like wilde Buls against Lyons, or else it will be in vaine
to march vp into the field.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">There were, however, more than three London companies
about 1608. M. de la Boderie tells us how one fell into disgrace during
that year, and how four others subscribed to buy off the consequent
inhibition of plays.<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> The reconciliation is simple. Dekker has in
mind only the ‘public’ and not the ‘private’ houses. Of these Paul’s
was closed in 1606; it was made worth its Master’s while not to reopen
it. The Blackfriars was used by the successive boy companies, known
generically as the Queen’s Revels, until 1608 or 1609, when it passed
to the King’s men, who thereafter maintained it as a winter house, to
supplement the Globe. The Queen’s Revels then moved to the Whitefriars,
a private house built at some time before 1608, and occupied in that
year by the ephemeral company of the King’s Revels.</p>

<p>An increase in the number of adult companies now made fresh demands
upon theatrical house-room. It is presumably the Duke of York’s men
who were described at Leicester in 1608 as ‘the Princes players
of the White Chapple, London’. The description suggests that they
used the Boar’s Head, but if so, nothing more is heard of it, and
it is conceivable that they soon succeeded to the Curtain. The Lady
Elizabeth’s, who came into existence in 1611, are traceable at
the Swan, which Henslowe may have taken over to succeed the Rose,
disused, if not pulled down, by 1606. The following lines are in John
Heath’s <i>Two Centuries of Epigrammes</i> (1610), but may of course,
especially as the Red Bull is not named,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span> date back to the period when
the Curtain was still in the hands of the Queen’s men:</p>

  </div>

<p class="p-left">A foreign traveller again gives us help. The relation of the visit of
Prince Lewis Frederick of Württemberg in 1610 merely records that he
went to the Globe, and Justus Zingerling, who was in London at about
the same date, has the briefest note of the existence of ‘theatra
comoedorum et in quibus ursi et tauri cum canibus committuntur’.<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>
But the itinerary of Prince Otto of Hesse-Cassel in the following year
is more expansive. The compiler writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In London there are seven theatres, where daily, except on
Sundays, comedies are performed, whereof the most important is
the Globe, which lies over the water. The theatre, where the
children play, is on the hither side of the water; they play
at three o’clock, but only from Michaelmas to Easter. Here it
only costs half a shilling to enter, but for the other places
at least half a crown. These play only with lights, and are the
best company in London.’<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span></p>

<p class="p-left">In addition to the Globe and the Whitefriars, the tale of seven
theatres is probably made up by the Blackfriars, the Fortune, the Red
Bull, the Curtain, and the Swan.</p>

<p>Henslowe’s correspondence with Daborne shows that he still had a
‘publique howse’, probably the Swan, in December 1613, and also that
in June of that year his company was only just thinking of ‘comming
over’ for a summer season, presumably from the Whitefriars, as he had
recently carried out an amalgamation between the Lady Elizabeth’s
men and the Queen’s Revels.<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> In the following year occurred an
episode which curiously emphasizes the constant shifting of the focus
of theatrical interest during the whole of the period with which we
are concerned. Originally stageland was in the heart of the City
itself. With the building of the first theatres, it was transferred
to the Fields of the northern suburbs. During the last decade of the
sixteenth century the Fields in their turn gave way to the Bankside.
The Rose, the Swan, and the Globe successively made their appearance,
and the vestry of Southwark began to echo the earlier outcry of the
City against the iniquities of players, until their mouths were stopped
with tithes. But the transpontine period proved a brief one. Hardly was
the Globe up, before Alleyn’s choice of a site for the Fortune set the
fashion veering again, and opened up a new theatrical region in the
western suburbs. This was convenient for the Court and the great houses
along the Strand and for the lawyers in the Temple and at Westminster,
as well as for the City proper, and its tradition has endured until
quite recent years. The Red Bull and the Whitefriars followed in the
same area. On the other hand, the Rose had vanished, and the King’s
men, although they did not desert the Globe, acknowledged the change
of venue by taking up their winter quarters in the Blackfriars hard
by. One result was that men who had ridden to the Fields and been
ferried to the Bankside, now walked or drove in their coaches to the
theatre door. During the spring of 1614 things were probably at their
worst. Both the Globe, after its fire, and the Hope were still in the
builder’s hands, and if the Lady Elizabeth’s lingered again at the
Whitefriars, there can have been no plays across the water at all.
The watermen, who twenty years before had exercised the influence
of their patron, the Lord Admiral, to induce the Privy Council to
revoke an inhibition on the Bankside houses, sent up a bitter cry
of protest. John Taylor, the ‘water-poet’, whom they chose as their
spokesman, tells the story.<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span> A petition to the King was prepared,
to the effect that no play-house might be permitted ‘in London or in
Middlesex, within four miles of the City on that side of the Thames’,
and with this Taylor pursued James to Theobalds, Newmarket, and
Royston. It recited the service done by watermen in the navy during the
Armada invasion of 1588 and in such expeditions as those of Essex in
1596 and 1597. And it proceeded:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Afterwards the players began to play on the Bankside and to
leave playing in London and Middlesex (for the most part),
then there went such great concourse of people by water that
the small number of watermen remaining at home were not able
to carry them, by reason of the court, the terms, the players,
and other employments, so that we were enforced and encouraged
(hoping that this golden stirring would have lasted ever) to
take and entertain men and boys.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">It was calculated that the number of watermen and their
dependants between Windsor and Gravesend had now by 1614 reached 40,000:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The cause of the greater half of which multitude hath been
the players playing on the Bankside, for I have known three
companies besides the bear-baiting, at once there; to wit, the
Globe, the Rose, and the Swan. And it is an infallible truth
that, had they never played there, it had been better for
watermen by the one half of their living, for the company is
increased more than half by their means of playing there in
former times.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Foreign employment had now come to an end:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘And the players have all (except the King’s men) left their
usuall residency on the Bankside, and do play in Middlesex far
remote from the Thames, so that every day in the week they do
draw unto them three or four thousand people, that were used to
spend their monies by water.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Such, Taylor assures us, was the effect of the petition. It was
referred by James to ‘his commissioners for suits’, that is to say, the
Court of Requests, composed of Sir Julius Caesar, Sir Thomas Parry, Sir
Francis Bacon, Sir Henry Montagu, Sir Walter Cope, George Calvert, and
Baron Sotherton. The King’s men exhibited a counter-petition, and the
case came on for hearing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Sir Francis Bacon very worthily said that so far as the public
weal was to be regarded before pastimes, or a serviceable
decaying multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span> before a handful of particular men, or
profit before pleasure, so far was our suit to be preferred
before theirs.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The players appealed to the Earl of Somerset, who became Lord
Chamberlain and in that capacity their official protector on 10 July
1614, but he proved well affected towards the watermen. The hearing was
adjourned and never resumed, owing to the death of Cope on 31 July,
the promotion of Caesar to the Mastership of the Rolls on 1 October,
and the consequent dissolution of the commission. Ill feeling broke
out between Taylor and his fellows the watermen, who declared that
he met the players at supper at the Cardinal’s Hat on Bankside, and
took bribes of them to let the suit fall. Taylor, therefore, wrote his
pamphlet to vindicate his position.<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> The completion of the new
Globe and the Hope during the progress of the dispute had probably
eased matters temporarily for the watermen, but the growing tendency
of things theatrical towards Middlesex was not permanently checked.
Some of the minor companies used the Hope until 1617, and then left
it to the bears again. The Globe survived, but will be found to have
occupied during the Caroline period a distinctly secondary position
to the Blackfriars in the economy of the King’s men. For this there
was another reason besides the geographical superiority of Middlesex
over Surrey. The acquisition of the Blackfriars, even though only for
winter purposes, in 1608 was an acknowledgement of the advantages for
adult companies of the ‘private’ or roofed type of theatre, hitherto
used only by boys. Once these advantages were realized, the doom of
the old ‘ring’ type, with its central opening, was written. Probably
the Hope was the only new house constructed on these lines after 1608,
and obviously the Hope required free ventilation to get rid of the
stink of bears and dogs. In 1615 Philip Rosseter and others obtained
sanction for the conversion of Porter’s Hall in the Blackfriars into
a theatre. This was to be used by children as well as adults, and was
probably roofed. It was pulled down again by what seems a somewhat
arbitrary decision in 1617. About the same time, the roofed Cockpit in
Drury Lane was converted into a theatre, under the name of the Phoenix,
for the occupation of the Queen’s men, who migrated to it from the Red
Bull. Whether or not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span> Fortune was given a roof at the rebuilding
of 1623, or the Red Bull at somewhat the same time, is uncertain; but
at any rate the Salisbury Court theatre, built near the Whitefriars
in 1629, perhaps to replace the old Whitefriars theatre, was a roofed
house.<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> This was the last new theatre built before the civil
wars. The Blackfriars, the Cockpit, and Salisbury Court were the most
important of the Caroline stages, and in the post-Restoration houses,
although these were on a larger scale than the ‘private’ houses of the
past, the roofed model was invariably adopted.</p>

<p>Soon after the completion of Salisbury Court, Edmund Howes, who had
already edited the fourth edition of John Stowe’s <i>Annales</i> in
1615, was again revising the text for the fifth edition of 1631, and
took occasion to append to his account of the burnings of the Globe
and the Fortune the following summary of theatrical enterprise since
1569:<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In the yeere one thousand sixe hundred twenty nine, there was
builded a new faire Play-house, neere the white Fryers. And this
is the seauenteenth Stage, or common Play-house, which hath
beene new made within the space of threescore yeeres within
London and the Suburbs, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>‘Fiue Innes, or common Osteryes turned to Play-houses, one
<i>Cockpit</i>, S. <i>Paules</i> singing Schoole, one in the
<i>Black-fryers</i>, and one in the <i>White-fryers</i>, which
was built last of all, in the yeare one thousand sixe hundred
twenty nine, all the rest not named, were erected only for
common Play-houses, besides the new built Beare garden, which
was built as well for playes, and Fencers prizes, as Bull
bayting; besides, one in former time at <i>Newington</i> Buts;
Before the space of threescore yeares aboue-sayd, I neither
knew, heard, nor read, of any such Theaters, set Stages, or
Play-houses, as haue beene purposely built within mans memory.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">This passage serves as a fair summary of the detailed
investigations set out in this chapter. Howes only allows one house
to the Blackfriars and one to the Whitefriars, and must therefore be
leaving out of account the abortive Porter’s Hall house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span> and treating
Salisbury Court as a continuation of the earlier Whitefriars. The Hope
and Newington Butts are afterthoughts, and make his seventeen into
nineteen. We can identify his five inns as the Bull, the Bell, the
Cross Keys, the Bel Savage, and probably the Red Lion, although this
just antedates his period of sixty years; while his balance of eight
unnamed common play-houses must be the Theatre, the Curtain, the Rose,
the Swan, the Globe, the Fortune, the Boar’s Head, and the Red Bull.</p>

<p>Prynne, in his <i>Histriomastix</i> (1633), records six ‘divels
chappels’ as then in use, and these are doubtless the six houses, the
Blackfriars, Globe, Cockpit, Salisbury Court, Fortune, and Red Bull,
which are also noted by the Restoration writers on the stage, John
Downes and James Wright, as surviving up to the cataclysm of the civil
wars.<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a></p>

<p>Somewhat more confused and vague in their datings are the reminiscences
about 1660 of the Marquis of Newcastle in his letter of advice to

And now built vp againe in the yeare 1613, at the great charge

<p>‘The Hope, on the Banks side in Southwarke, commonly called
the Beare Garden, a Play House for Stage Playes on Mundayes,
Wedensdayes, Fridayes, and Saterdayes, and for the baiting of
the Beares on Tuesdayes and Thursdayes, the stage being made
to take vp and downe when they please. It was built in the
year 1610, and now pulled downe to make tennementes, by Thomas
Walker, a peticoate maker in Cannon Streete, on Tuesday the 25
day of March 1656. Seuen of M<sup>r</sup>. Godfries beares, by the command
of Thomas Pride, then hie Sheriefe of Surry, were then shot to
death, on Saterday the 9 day of February 1655, by a company of
souldiers.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Downes and Wright do not mention the Hope, as they were
not discussing baiting. On the other hand, the annalist says nothing
of the fate of the Red Bull, which in fact appears to have escaped
destruction, to have been occasionally used for ‘drolls’ during the
Commonwealth, and to have served once more, with the Cockpit and
Salisbury Court, the demolition of which was probably limited to the
interior fittings, for the first entertainments of the Restoration.
The building of Vere Street in 1660, Lincoln’s Inn Fields in 1661, and
Drury Lane in 1663 made them obsolete.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a></p>

<p>These records leave ambiguous the fate of the Curtain and the Swan. The
Curtain is traceable in occasional use up to about 1627, and is figured
as a roundish building in the ‘Ryther’ maps, which are probably of a
decade later.<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> It cannot, therefore, have vanished long before
the civil wars, and was the most long-lived of all the theatres. It
may, of course, have been rebuilt, later than its original foundation
in 1576, but as to this there is no evidence. The ‘Ryther’ maps also
show the Fortune. No other maps give any of the theatres on the north
of the river. Of the Bankside houses, the Swan is shown by a decagonal
ground-plan, with the inscription ‘Old Play house’, in the Paris Garden
Manor survey of 1627.<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> And it is described as still existing side
by side with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span> the Globe and the Hope, but clearly also as derelict, in

beeing in times past as famous as any of the other, was now
fallen to decay, and like a dying <i>Swanne</i>, hanging downe

<p>I turn now to the maps of the Bankside, which, had they been datable,
and drawn with cartographical precision, ought not only to have
furnished valuable evidence as to the duration of the theatres, but
also to have indicated accurately the position of each amongst the
streets and lanes of the district. Neither condition is, however,
fulfilled. Even where the date of an engraving is known, the date of
the survey on which it was based can, as a rule, be only approximately
determined. And the constant intrusion of pictorial elements, which
gives the maps the character of perspective views rather than of
plans, is naturally emphasized on the Bankside, which has to serve as
a foreground to the design. The main topographical features which have
to be borne in mind are simple, and can easily be related to those in
John Rocque’s map of 1746, as interpreted by Strype’s <i>Survey</i>
of 1720, or in a modern Ordnance map. The whole region concerned lies
roughly between the southern approaches to London and Blackfriars
Bridges. It underwent a good deal of development during one period,
especially in the area of the Clink, a liberty lying between Southwark
on the east and another liberty of Paris Garden on the west, and
affording a convenient suburban resort outside the jurisdiction of
the City. Stowe’s account of the neighbourhood in 1598 is perhaps a
little misleading. He describes no more than the Bankside proper, ‘a
continuall building of tenements’ on the riverside, extending about
half a mile west of London Bridge. Here he places, from west to east,
the bear gardens, the former stews, the prison of the Clink, Winchester
House, and the church of St. Mary Overie in Southwark.<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> This
agrees pretty well with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span> the maps of Agas (<i>c.</i> 1561) and Norden
(1593), except that there was already a group of houses falling outside
Stowe’s purview, which stood on the river near Paris Garden Stairs and
practically continued the Bankside westwards. But there was also, which
Stowe does not mention, a marshy <i>hinterland</i> to the Bankside,
of ponds and gardens, among which Agas, and still more Norden, show
a good many scattered houses. By the end of the century there was a
fairly definite north to south street known as Deadman’s Place, which
debouched from the east end of the Bankside, and from which in its turn
struck out one called Maid or Maiden Lane, which went in an irregular
line westwards over the marshes, and was finally joined by two
divergent ways, Love Lane and Gravel (afterwards Holland) Lane, to the
Paris Garden group of houses. Thus was formed a rough parallelogram,
half a mile long, and from 200 to 350 feet deep, within or near which
all the theatrical sites are placed by the maps. In Norden’s map of
1593, both the Bear House and the Play House, which must be the Rose,
stand considerably to the west of Deadman’s Place. The Bear House is
the most westerly of the two, and is about halfway between the Bankside
houses on the north and Maid Lane on the south. The Rose is a good
deal nearer Maid Lane. In the Delaram views (1603–20) there are three
flagged, but unnamed, structures. One which stands well back from
the river and, after allowing for the view-point, appears slightly
the most easterly of the three, is cylindrical; the upper half is
alone windowed, and has a smaller diameter than the lower half. It is
placed amongst trees and meadows. There is nothing which obviously
indicates Maid Lane.<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> The two other buildings stand much nearer
the river’s edge, amongst houses; they are angled, probably octagonal,
and not cylindrical. The ‘Hondius’ views repeat the cylindrical
building and the most westerly of the two angled buildings much in
the same relative position; the intermediate one has disappeared. It
seems obvious that the cylindrical building must be the Globe, and
the other two the Bear Garden, afterwards the Hope, to the west, and
the Rose, left out of the ‘Hondius’ group, because it disappeared in
1605, in the centre. The Delaram and ‘Hondius’ views do not extend
far enough west to include the Swan. It is shown by Visscher in 1616,
and named. So are the Bear Garden and the Globe, both of which appear
as angled buildings, octagonal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span> or hexagonal, about equidistant from
the Bankside houses, and north of Maid Lane, the angle of which next
Deadman’s Place is shown.<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> As the change from a cylindrical to an
angled representation of the Globe coincides with the rebuilding of the
house in 1614, we may perhaps infer that the structural form is not a
mere cartographic convention.<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> It is rather singular that in the
Merian maps (<i>circa</i> 1638) there are four houses again, including
the Swan, well to the west. This, with two of the three houses in the
eastern group, is named by the engraver. A third unnamed house stands
between the Globe on the east and the Bear Garden on the west, which is
approximately where the Rose used to stand. It is distinctly nearer the
river than the other two, but all three are north of Maid Lane, from
which the Bear Garden is slightly more remote than the Globe.<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> If
the Rose had actually a second term of existence, it was probably only
a brief one.<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> The fullest of the Ryther maps (<i>c.</i> 1636–45)
has two angled buildings, one to the west, rather nearer to Bankside
than to Maid Lane; the other to the east, and south of Maid Lane,
standing in an angle between that and a track running from north-west
to south-east. There are no names, but obviously the eastern house is
the Globe, and the western the Hope, and indeed the dogs can be made
out. The track joining Maid Lane may be Globe Alley. The Hollar view of
1647 shows two cylindrical, not angled, buildings. One lettered ‘The
Globe’ is on the extreme brink of the river; the other, to the east and
south of it, is lettered ‘Beere bayting’. Faithorne and Newcourt, in
1658, give no theatres proper, but only a ring marked ‘Beare garden’.
Finally, Leeke and Hollar about 1666 give a single unnamed roundish
theatre, south of Maid Lane. Presumably it is the Globe, but copied
from a survey of earlier date, as the Globe had been pulled down for
tenements in 1644.</p>

<p>On the whole, the maps are disappointing guides. It seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span> more
probable than has quite been recognized, that the singular two-storied
structure shown by Hondius and Delaram really represents the earlier,
the Shakespearian, Globe. And the representation of a fourth house by
Merian, even if he did not know its name, gives support to the view
that the Rose may have had some kind of existence at a later date than
the Sewers records indicate. But as regards the alinement, the distance
from the river, and the relation to Maid Lane, of the three houses in
the Clink, it is clear that no consistent story is told. The general
impression one gets is that the Hope stood farthest to the west, then
the Rose, and then the Globe; and that the Rose stood nearest to the
river, then the Hope, and then the Globe. Nor is this inconsistent with
documentary evidence, which in particular indicates that the parcel of
land, on which the latest of the Bear Gardens was built, was contiguous
on the west to that known as ‘the little Rose’.<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Bear Garden and
Rose Alley, running side by side from the Bankside into Maid Lane
or Park Street, are traceable in eighteenth-century maps and in the
modern Ordnance map.<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> Did one judge by the maps alone, one would
probably, in spite of the dissenting testimony of ‘Ryther’ and of Leeke
and Hollar, come to the conclusion that the Globe stood to the north
of Maid Lane. The balance of other evidence points unmistakably in the
other direction.<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></p>

<p>i. THE RED LION INN</p>

<p class="p-left">This is the only notice of the Red Lion playing-inn which
has been preserved, but John Brayne, grocer, is doubtless the same who
financed his brother-in-law, James Burbadge, in the far more important
enterprise of the Theatre in 1576. Stebunheth or Stepney was a parish
in Middlesex, lying to the east of the City, beyond Whitechapel, and,
although near enough to be in a sense a suburb, was outside the civic
jurisdiction.</p>


<h5>ii. THE BULL INN</h5>

<p>The first notice of the Bull is on 7 June 1575 when the playing of a
‘prize’ there is recorded in the register of the School of Defence.
It appears to have been the most popular of all localities for this
purpose and there are fourteen similar notices of its use in the
register, ending with one on 3 July 1590.<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> Florio refers to it
as a place for plays in 1578.<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> Stephen Gosson in his <i>Schoole
of Abuse</i> (1579) exempts from his ordinary condemnation of plays
<i>The Jew</i> and <i>Ptolemy</i> ‘shown at the Bull’.<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> On 1
July 1582 the Earl of Warwick asked permission from the Lord Mayor
for his servant John David to play his provost prizes at ‘the Bull
in Bishopsgatestrete or some other conuenient place to be assigned
within the liberties of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span> London’. This was refused, much to Warwick’s
annoyance, on the ground that an inn was a place ‘somewhat to close
for infection’, and David appointed to play ‘in an open place of the
Leaden hall’.<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> The Bull, with the Bell, was assigned by a civic
order of 28 November 1583 to the Queen’s men for their first winter
season. Tarlton and the Queen’s men are said in the <i>Jests</i> to
have played ‘oftentimes’ at ‘the Bull in Bishops-gate-street’, and
here their play of <i>The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth</i>,
with Tarlton in the parts of the judge and the clown and Knell in that
of Henry, was given.<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> This must, of course, have been between
1583 and Tarlton’s death in 1588. In 1592 the translator of <i>The
Spaniard’s Monarchie</i> disclaims any ‘title fetched from the Bull
within Bishopsgate, as a figge for a Spaniard’. I do not know whether
any old play underlying the Admiral’s (q.v.) <i>Spanish Fig</i> of
1601–2 can be referred to. The house was still in use during 1594, for
in April or May of that year Anthony Bacon settled in Bishopsgate, to
the vexation of his mother, ‘on account of its neighbourhood to the
Bull Inn, where plays and interludes were continually acted, and would,
she imagined, corrupt his servants’.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> Richard Flecknoe mentions
the Bull in Bishopsgate Street, with the Cross-Keys, as one of the inns
turned into theatres at the beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, as
was ‘at this day to be seen’ in 1664.<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> The site was at No. 91 on
the west of Bishopsgate Street, and is shown in Hatton’s map of 1708,
and the Ordnance Survey maps of 1848–51 and 1875.</p>


<h5>iii. THE BELL INN</h5>

<p>This inn existed in 1560, for on 12 June of that year ‘the wyff of the
Bell in Gracyous-strett’ was carted as a bawd and whore.<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> Plays
must have been used there in 1576–7, in the Revels Account for which
year an item of 10<i>d.</i> is included ‘ffor the cariadge of the
partes of y<sup>e</sup> well counterfeit from the Bell in Gracious strete to St.
Iohns to be performed for the play of Cutwell’.<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> With the Bull,
it was assigned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span> Queen’s men by a civic order of 28 November
1583 for their first winter season. <i>Tarlton’s Jests</i> also mention
Tarlton and ‘his fellowes’, probably the Queen’s men, as performing at
the Bell ‘by’ the Cross Keys which was also in Gracious Street, and
this must have been before Tarlton’s death in 1588.<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> Both houses
may be included in Rawlidge’s reference to play-houses in Gracious
street and elsewhere ‘put down’ by the City in Elizabeth’s time. I
suppose that the site is that of Bell Yard at No. 12 on the west of
Gracechurch Street.<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>


<h5>iv. THE BEL SAVAGE INN</h5>

<p>The Bel Savage is named as an early London play-house in the 1596
edition of Lambarde’s <i>Perambulation of Kent</i>. This inn, of
which the name is still preserved on Ludgate Hill, where it stood
until 1873 (Harben, 63), must be distinguished from another in
Gracechurch Street once kept by Tarlton, which in his time was known
as the Saba.<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> The origin of the name is obscure; a deed of 1452
refers to an ‘inn ... called Savages Inn, otherwise called the Bell
on the Hoop, in the parishe of St. Bride in Fleet Street’ (<i>L. T.
R.</i> ii. 71). Probably therefore the notion of the Belle Sauvage
is a later perversion. Gascoigne, in the prologue to his <i>Glass
of Government</i> (1575), repudiates the ‘worthie jests’ and ‘vain
delights’ of ‘Bellsavage fair’.<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> Gosson, in 1579, excepts from
his general condemnation of plays ‘the two prose books, played at the
Belsavage, where you shall find never a word without wit, never a
line without pith, never a letter placed in vain’.<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> A play-house
‘on Ludgate Hill’ is included by Rawlidge in his list of those ‘put
down’ in Elizabeth’s time. Probably the Queen’s men were acting at the
Bel Savage in 1588, for after the death of Tarlton in that year was
published ‘a sorowfull newe sonnette, intituled Tarltons Recantacion
uppon this theame gyven him by a gentleman at the Belsavage without
Ludgate (nowe or els never) beinge the laste theame he songe’.<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a>
Prynne’s reference to <i>Dr. Faustus</i> (q.v.) at the Bel Savage
suggests that at some time the Admiral’s also played there. It was also
occasionally used for the playing of ‘prizes’; the earliest recorded
date in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span> the Register of the School of Defence being in 1575–7 and the
latest on 31 January 1589.<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a></p>


<h5>v. THE CROSS KEYS INN</h5>

<p>This inn may have been the play-house, or one of the play-houses,
‘in Gracious Street’ said by Rawlidge to have been ‘put down’ under
Elizabeth. The first notice of it dates from 23 June 1579, on which day
James Burbadge was arrested at the suit of John Hynde for £5 1<i>s.</i>
1<i>d.</i>, ‘as he came down Gracious Street towards the Cross Keys
there to a play’. The house is described as the dwelling-house of
Richard Ibotson, citizen and brewer of London.<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> It was in use as
a place of popular amusement during the life of Tarlton, who died in
1588, for one of the Jests relates how he came from the Bell, where he
was playing to ‘the Crosse-Keyes in Gracious streete’ to see Banks’s
performing horse there.<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> A company can first be definitely
located at it in 1589, on 5 November of which year Lord Strange’s men,
as reported by Lord Mayor Hart to Burghley, disobeyed an admonition
to forbear playing, and ‘went to the Crosse Keys and played that
afternoon’. In 1594 Strange’s men were absorbed in Lord Hunsdon’s, and
on 8 October 1594 Hunsdon wrote to the Lord Mayor to obtain toleration
for ‘my nowe companie of players’ who had been accustomed ‘to plaie
this winter time within the citye at the Crosse Kayes in Gracious
street’.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> How long Shakespeare’s fellows continued to use the
Cross Keys as a winter house is unknown; presumably it ceased to be
available in 1596. The adaptation of the inn as a theatre was still
visible at the Restoration, and is assigned by Richard Flecknoe to
‘about the beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s reign’. The site is shown in
Ogilby and Morgan’s map of 1677 and the Ordnance Survey map of 1848–51:
it is on the west of Gracechurch Street.</p>

by W. W. Braines in <i>Holywell Priory and the Site of the
Theatre, Shoreditch</i> (1915, <i>Indication of Houses of
Historical Interest in London</i>, xliii), and again in <i>The
Site of the Theatre, Shoreditch</i> (1917, <i>L. T. R.</i> xi.
1).]</p>
</div>

<p>The following statement as to the beginnings of theatrical enterprise
in London is made by Cuthbert Burbadge and his family in the so-called
<i>Sharers Papers</i> of 1635:<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The father of us, Cutbert and Richard Burbage, was the first
builder of playehowses, and was himselfe in his younger yeeres
a player. The Theater hee built with many hundred poundes taken
up at interest. The players that lived in those first times had
onely the profitts arising from the dores, but now the players
receave all the commings in at the dores to themselves and halfe
the galleries from the houskepers. Hee built this house upon
leased ground, by which meanes the landlord and hee had a great
suite in law, and, by his death, the like troubles fell on us,
his sonnes; wee then bethought us of altering from thence, and
at like expence built the Globe.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The accuracy of this is fully borne out by the records
of the various legal proceedings in connexion with the Theatre, which
a painful investigation has exhumed, and the topographical indications
furnished by the evidence in some of these have made it possible
to locate with some precision the site of London’s first regular
play-house.</p>

<p>The Theatre stood in the Liberty of Halliwell or Holywell, part of the
Middlesex parish of St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, immediately outside
the Bishopsgate entrance to the City.<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span> The name of the Liberty
was derived from an ancient holy well, which has now disappeared, and
its status from the fact that it had been the property of a priory of
Benedictine nuns. The buildings of the priory lay between Shoreditch
High Street, leading north from Bishopsgate, on the east and the open
Finsbury fields on the west. Its southern gate was in a lane leading
from the High Street to the Fields, then and still known as Holywell
Lane or Street, on the south of which lay the Prioress’s pasture
called the Curtain. Part of this south end of the liberty, lying on
both sides of Holywell Lane, had been leased in 1537 and 1538 to the
Earls of Rutland, who continued to hold it from the Crown after the
dissolution in 1539, and obtained a renewed lease in 1584.<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> The
rest of the property, including the main conventual buildings, was
sold in 1544 to one Henry Webb, whose daughter Susan and her husband
Sir George Peckham sold it in 1555 to Christopher Bumsted, and he in
the same year to Christopher Allen and his son Giles. The alienation
of 1555 was challenged as illegal by Susan Peckham’s heirs in 1582,
and ultimately, but not until about thirty years later, they appear
to have made good their claim.<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> In the meantime Giles Allen had
leased a part of the property, which became the site of the Theatre,
to James Burbadge on 13 April 1576.<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> This was bounded to the
north by the wall of Allen’s own garden, probably corresponding to the
main cloister of the convent, on the east or south-east by the Earl
of Rutland’s holding, and on the west by a ditch dividing it from the
open Finsbury fields. Within the ditch and divided from it by a strip
of void ground, was the old brick wall of the precinct. On the extreme
south was a bit of void ground lying between an Oat Barn occupied by
Rutland and another Great Barn included in the lease. The Oat Barn and
the void ground were in fact debatable property claimed both by Allen
and Rutland. North of the Great Barn, and immediately to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span> east of
the precinct wall was more void and garden ground; farther to the east
the ‘inner court yarde’ of the convent. This held tenements backing
upon Allen’s garden to the north, and others, including a mill-house,
backing on the garden ground to the west. In this yard was a well,
probably the eponymous ‘Holywell’, which fed a horsepond by Rutland’s
stable on the south-east, and then drained away through the debatable
ground to the Finsbury ditch.<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> Since Burbadge’s barn is known to
have been shored up to the Theatre, it is evident that this must have
been constructed in the void and garden ground between the tenements
and the precinct wall, and as there was no right of way through
Rutland’s holding from Holywell Lane, an entrance was made through
the wall direct from Finsbury fields. The Theatre itself, indeed, was
sometimes loosely spoken of as ‘in the fields’.<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> Working from
later title-deeds of the locality, Mr. Braines has successfully located
the precise site of the building in the angle now formed by Curtain
Road, which occupies the strip of void ground between the precinct wall
and Finsbury ditch, and New Inn Yard, which occupies a strip of the
‘debateable ground’ and a strip also of the site of the Great Barn.
The site is now part of the premises of the Curtain Road Elementary
School.<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span></p>

<p>Burbadge’s lease was for a term of twenty-one years from Lady Day 1576.
He was to pay a fine of £20 and an annual rent of £14. He covenanted
to spend £200 within the first ten years in improving the existing
buildings, and in return Allen covenanted to make a new lease for
twenty-one years at any time within the first ten years, and also
to allow the tenant at any time within the term of either lease ‘to
take down such building as should within the sayd tenne yeeres be
erected on the sayd voyde growndes for a theater or playinge place’.
It was also agreed that Allen and his wife and family ‘vpon lawfull
request therfore made’ should be entitled ‘to enter or come into
the premisses and their in some one of the vpper romes to have such
convenient place to sett or stande to se such playes as shalbe ther
played freely without any thinge therefore payeinge soe that the sayd
Gyles hys wyfe and familie doe com and take ther places before they
shalbe taken vpp by any others’. Burbadge, a joiner as well as a
player, had probably the technical qualifications for his enterprise.
But he was a man of small means, not worth above 100 marks, and had no
credit.<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> He found a partner in his brother-in-law, John Brayne,
a well-to-do grocer of Bucklersbury, who had already been connected
with a play-house speculation at the Red Lion inn. The association
proved a calamitous one, and its history can only be traced through
the dubious <i>ex parte</i> statements of later litigation. Burbadge,
in an unfortunately mutilated document, appears to have alleged that
Brayne acquired an interest by means of a promise, which he afterwards
evaded, to leave it to his sister’s children.<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> Robert Miles,
of the George Inn, Whitechapel, a friend of Brayne, who supported
and ultimately inherited the case of his widow, told a different
story.<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> He had heard Burbadge ‘earnestlie insynuate’ Brayne to
join in the transaction, as one which ‘wold grow to ther contynual
great profitt and commodytie’. Brayne was ‘verye loth to deale in
the matter’, and complained later to Miles that it was ‘his vtter
vndoing’, and that he would never have touched it, but for the ‘swete
and contynuall’ persuasions of Burbadge. His brother-in-law had assured
him that the cost of erecting the play-house would not exceed £200,
and after it had already cost £500, urged that ‘it was no matter’,
and that the profits ‘wold shortlie quyte the cost vnto them bothe’.
Obviously Brayne was out for profits, and had to take his risks. But if
the account of Miles is to be trusted, he had also definite grievances
against his partner. Burbadge’s small contribution to the outlay was
partly made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span> in material, for which he overcharged at the rate of
sixpence for a groat’s worth. When funds ran short, Brayne and his
wife worked as labourers on the structure, while Burbadge, if he set
his hand to a job, took the regular rate of wages for it. And there
is some corroboration of a more serious charge of ‘indyrect dealing’,
after the house was opened, about the ‘collecting of the money for
the gallories’.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> Miles alleged that during a space of two years
Burbadge used a secret key made by one Braye, a smith in Shoreditch,
to filch from ‘the commen box where the money gathered at the said
playes was putt in’, thus cheating ‘his fellowes the players’ as well
as Brayne. He would also ‘thrust some of the money devident betwene him
and his said ffellowes in his bosome or other where about his bodye’.
The Theatre was in use by 1 August 1577, as it is mentioned by name
in the Privy Council inhibition of that date.<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> But it was opened
before the work was completed, and the last stages were paid for out of
the profits.<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> Moreover, in addition to what Brayne and Burbadge
could find, money had to be raised on mortgage, with the result that
Brayne never got full security for his interest in the undertaking.
He was not a party to the original lease, thinking that if a joint
lease were entered into, the survivor would take all.<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> When a
draft assurance of a moiety of the profits to him was prepared on 9
August 1577, it could not be executed because the lease was at pawn,
and ultimately, on 22 May 1578, Burbadge gave him a bond of £400 to
assure in due course.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> An assurance was, however, never made. The
friction between the partners led to violent disputes. On one occasion,
after high words in a scrivener’s shop, ‘Burbage did there strike him
with his fist and so they went together by the eares in somuch that
this deponent could herdly part them’.<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> On 12 July 1578 they
submitted their differences to arbitrators, who decided that, with
the exception of 10<i>s.</i> weekly for Brayne’s housekeeping and 8s.
for Burbadge’s out of the profits of ‘such playes as should be playd
there vpon Sundaies’, the first charge upon the rents and profits of
the property should be the repayment of debts due upon the theatre.
Thereafter Brayne should take them ‘till he shuld be answered suche
somes of money which he had lade out for and vpon the same Theatre
more then the said Burbage had done’. And when this claim too was
discharged, the rents and profits should ‘go in devydent equallye
betwene them’. Should it be necessary to raise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span> money on mortgage,
it should be a joint mortgage, and its redemption would then come in
as the first claim on the rents and profits. Burbadge gave Brayne
a further bond of £200 for the keeping of this award.<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> On 26
September 1579 a mortgage was in fact entered into for a loan of £125
from John Hyde, grocer, to be repaid in a year. The amount, however,
was not forthcoming, and although Hyde made an arrangement to take
£5 a week out of the profits, he only got it for four or five weeks.
In June 1582 he arrested Burbadge and got £20 out of him. Shortly
afterwards he claimed forfeiture of the lease, and as Burbadge warned
him that Brayne ‘wold catch what he cold’, appointed one of his own
servants with Burbadge ‘to gather vp v<sup>li</sup> wekely during the tyme
of playes’. In this way he got back another £20 or £30. There was,
however, still at least £30 outstanding when Brayne died in August
1586.<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> His widow Margaret claimed a moiety of the interest under
the lease as his heir. At first, we hear, Burbadge allowed her ‘half
of the profittes of the gallaries’, but only so long as she could lay
out money ‘to the necessary vse of the said playe howsse’, and when
she had so spent £30, he said that he must take all the profits until
the debts were paid, made her gather as a servant, and finally thrust
her out altogether.<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> Meanwhile Hyde was getting impatient for
his money. He had promised Mrs. Brayne that, if he were satisfied,
he would reassure the lease to her and Burbadge jointly, but not to
either party separately. But now he said that he must convey it to
whichever would pay him first, and being approached through Walter
Cope, the master of Burbadge’s son Cuthbert, he did in fact, on some
promise that Mrs. Brayne should not be wronged, take his £30 and make
over the lease to Cuthbert Burbadge on 7 June 1589.<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> Henceforward
Cuthbert, and not his father, was the ostensible tenant of the
property. This transaction stimulated Mrs. Brayne to assert her claims.
About a year before the Burbadges had brought an action against her
in Chancery, apparently in the hope of enforcing the alleged promise
of Brayne to leave his interest to his sister’s children; and she now
retorted with a counteraction against James and Cuthbert, in which
she claimed to have an assignment of a moiety of the lease.<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>
Her chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span> witness was the Robert Miles on whose statements this
narrative has already drawn. He was not of unimpeachable reputation.
His long association with Brayne had ended in a quarrel. Brayne had
‘charged Miles with his deathe, by certaine stripes geven him by
Miles’. The widow had accused him before the coroner and procured his
indictment as ‘a comon barreter’. Afterwards they had become friends,
and he was now maintaining Mrs. Brayne in her suit.<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> Much of his
evidence, however, received corroboration from his son Ralph, from
William Nicoll, a notary who had prepared the deeds connected with
the partnership, and from Edward Collins, who had acquired Brayne’s
grocery business in Bucklersbury. Burbadge, on the other hand, relied
largely on one Henry Bett, who had had an opportunity of perusing Mrs.
Brayne’s papers, and had then transferred his services to the other
side. We cannot perhaps assume that all the evidence in the cross-suits
is preserved. So far as what we have goes, there seems to have been
no attempt on Burbadge’s part to defend himself against the charge of
indirect dealing during the early years of partnership. Nor were the
main facts as to the history of the lease much in dispute. The chief
issue was as to Mrs. Brayne’s equitable claim to an interest in it,
and this of course turned largely on the state of the account between
Brayne and Burbadge at the death of the former. Miles asserted that
the expenditure on the building of the Theatre in cash and credit had
been practically all Brayne’s, that he had started as a rich man, but
had had to sell his lease and stock in Bucklersbury and pawn his own
wardrobe and his wife’s to get the work finished, that he was ruined,
and that Mrs. Brayne was now ‘vtterlye vndone’ by the suit, and owed
500 marks to her friends.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> On the other side it was claimed that
Brayne’s wealth, variously reputed at from £500 to £1,000, had been
exaggerated, that he was already involved when he took the Theatre in
hand, and that his downfall was largely due to unfortunate investments
outside the partnership, especially in a soap-making business carried
on with Miles at the George, where in fact Burbadge had incurred losses
in helping him.<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> Bett, moreover, said that, while Brayne ‘would
never plainlie declare’ what his profits on the Theatre had been, ‘yt
seemed by his taulke, that he had gayned and receyved a grete deale of
monye, more than he had disbursed’.<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> The actual figures produced
in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span> of the case, which are sufficient to enable us to arrive
at a fair estimate of the main position, do not quite bear out this
suggestion. Towards the original outlay Burbadge seems to have found
about £50; Brayne as much and £239 more, which he claimed as due to him
from the partnership. In addition there were outside debts outstanding
at the time of his death to the amount of at least £220. Something,
moreover, had already been spent out of takings before 1586 in payments
on Hyde’s mortgage. So that we may perhaps reasonably accept the total
cost of the building as being somewhere about the 1,000 marks (£666) at
which common repute estimated it.<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> A certain amount of building
material, worth perhaps 100 marks, was still in hand. All that Brayne
could be shown to have received as against his considerable outlay was
a sum of £135 1<i>s.</i>, for which his receipt was produced. What
Burbadge had received it is difficult to say. A comparison of various
estimates suggests that after Brayne’s death it may have been between
£100 and £200 a year.<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> On the other hand, he had paid off the debt
of £220 which Brayne had left outstanding. And throughout he had been
responsible, without aid from Brayne, for certain outgoings independent
of the structure of the Theatre, for which he was entitled to claim
credit. He had paid £230 in rent and laid out at least £220 in putting
the tenements in order, as well as at least £30 early in 1592 on the
repair of the Theatre itself.<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></p>

<p>The fortunes of the case in Chancery were various. In 1590 the
Court seemed inclined to grant a sequestration of half the profits;
but instead made an order that the arbitrament of 1578 should be
observed.<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> On the strength of this Mrs. Brayne and Miles came
to the Theatre on more than one occasion, and claimed to appoint
collectors, including one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span> Nicholas Bishop, who was asked to stand
‘at the door that goeth vppe to the gallaries of the said Theater to
take and receyve for the vse of the said Margarett half the money that
shuld be gyven to come vppe into the said gallaries at that door’. They
were, however, refused access, and on 16 November 1590 there was a row
royal, of which independent witness was borne by John Alleyn, of the
Admiral’s men, who were then playing at the Theatre. James Burbadge,
‘looking out at a wyndoe vpon them’, joined his wife in reviling them
as a murdering knave and whore, and expressed his contempt for the
order of Chancery; Cuthbert, who came home in the middle of the fray,
backed him up; while Richard Burbadge, the youngest son, snatched up a
broom-staff, and as he afterwards boasted, paid Robert Miles his moiety
with a beating. He also threatened Nicholas Bishop, ‘scornfully and
disdainfullye playing with this deponentes nose’. James said that at
their next coming his sons should provide pistols charged with powder
and hempseed to shoot them in the legs.<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> Both Cuthbert and James
were summoned on 28 November for contempt before the court, which
instead of dealing with this charge proceeded to take the whole case
into further consideration.<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> This was something of a triumph for
Burbadge, who continued to resist the order, and repeated with oaths
that twenty contempts and as many injunctions would not force him to
give up his property. This was heard by John Alleyn in the Theatre yard
about May 1591, and about eight days later ‘in the Attyring housse or
place where the players make them ready’, on the occasion of a dispute
with the Admiral’s men about some of ‘the dyvydent money between him
and them’ which he had detained, Burbadge was equally irreverent before
Alleyn and James Tunstall about the Lord Admiral himself, saying ‘by
a great othe, that he cared not for iij of the best lordes of them
all’.<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> Margaret Brayne died in 1593, leaving her estate to Miles,
who thus became a principal in the suit.<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> And on 28 May 1595 the
court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span> came to the decision that it could not entertain the case, until
Miles had endeavoured to obtain relief at common law, by suing on the
two bonds which Burbadge had given to Brayne in 1578.<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> He does not
seem to have thought it worth while to do this, probably because he
saw very little chance of recovering money from James Burbadge, while
Cuthbert, who now held the lease, was not a party to the bonds.<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a></p>

<p>It is the personality of Burbadge rather than the conduct of the
Theatre that these details illumine. But we may gather that the
building was constructed mainly of timber with some ironwork, that it
had a tiring-house and galleries, one at least of which was divided
into upper rooms, where spectators could sit as well as stand, and
that money was taken by appointed gatherers, placed in locked boxes,
and subsequently shared out amongst those entitled to it.<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> From
other sources it appears that 1<i>d.</i> was charged for admission
to the building and 1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> more for a place in the
galleries.<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> Apparently the players took the entrance fee and the
owners of the house the whole or an agreed proportion of the gallery
money. In the winter of 1585 an interesting arrangement was entered
into between Burbadge and Brayne on the one hand and Henry Lanman,
owner of the neighbouring Curtain, on the other, by which during a
period of seven years the Curtain was taken ‘as an Esore’ to the
Theatre, and the profits of both houses pooled and equally divided
between the two parties. This arrangement was still operative in
1592.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> Kiechel tells us that the number of galleries was three,
and De Witt that the shape was that of an ‘amphitheatrum’.<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> It is
impossible to trace with any certainty the successive occupation of the
Theatre by various companies of players or to reconstruct the list of
plays produced upon the boards. Its occupants were Burbadge’s ‘fellows’
at the time of his frauds of 1576–8, and may reasonably be identified
with Leicester’s, of whom he was certainly one in 1574.<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> Stephen
Gosson tells us in 1579 that amongst plays then ‘vsually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span> brought in
to the Theater’, were <i>The Blacksmith’s Daughter</i> and his own
<i>Catiline’s Conspiracies</i>, and in 1582 assigns to the same house
Lodge’s, if it was Lodge’s, <i>Play of Plays and Pastimes</i> given
on the last 23 February, the play of <i>The Fabii</i> and possibly
the history of <i>Caesar and Pompey</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> Presumably <i>The
Fabii</i> is <i>The Four Sons of Fabius</i>, presented by Warwick’s
men at Court on 1 January 1580. Warwick’s men had therefore probably
replaced Leicester’s at the Theatre, and it was the same men, then
in the service of the Earl of Oxford, who were concerned in a riot
at the Theatre on 10 April 1580.<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> In 1582 came the controversy
between Edmund Peckham and Giles Allen about the freehold of the
Theatre site, as a result of which Burbadge was ‘disturbed and trobled
in his possession’, and ‘the players for sooke the said Theater to
his great losse’.<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> So there was probably another change at this
time. And in 1583 there was a complete reshuffling of all the London
companies on the formation of the Queen’s men. Professor Wallace, who
is primarily considering that part of the evidence which he has himself
discovered, says that the Queen’s did not act at the Theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> But
most certainly they did. It is true that, when an inhibition against
the Theatre and Curtain was obtained on 14 June 1584, the owner of the
Theatre, ‘a stubburne fellow’, described himself as Lord Hunsdon’s man.
Nevertheless the only companies named as concerned are the Queen’s and
Arundel’s, and Burbadge may not himself have been then acting.<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>
And as to the presence of the Queen’s in the Theatre at some date there
is no doubt. Tarlton is not traceable in any other company than the
Queen’s, and it was at the Theatre that Tarlton made jests of Richard
Harvey’s <i>Astrological Discourse upon the Conjunction of Saturn and
Jupiter</i>, published in 1583.<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> The Queen’s certainly did not
confine themselves to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span> the Theatre; but that they were there again
in 1589 may be inferred from a mock testament of Martin Marprelate
in <i>Martins Month’s Mind</i>, in which he is made to admit that
he learned his twittle tattles ... at the Theater of Lanam and his
fellows’. A marginal note in the same pamphlet indicates that it was at
the Theatre that the ‘Maygame’ representing the ‘launcing and worming’
of Martin was staged, and there is other evidence that Laneham, then
one of the Queen’s men, was one of the players who took a part in
the ribald controversy.<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> Gabriel Harvey’s scoff at Lyly as ‘the
Foolemaster of the Theatre’ may perhaps indicate his authorship of
plays for the house. In 1590–1 it is clear that the Admiral’s men,
probably already associated with Strange’s, were at the Theatre, and
their quarrel with Burbadge doubtless led them to cross the river and
join Henslowe at the Rose. After the reconstitution of the companies
in 1594, James Burbadge’s son Richard became a leading member of the
Chamberlain’s men, and it is probable that, when this company left the
Rose about the middle of June, it was to the Theatre that they went.
Here <i>Hamlet</i>, which certainly belonged to them, was being acted
in 1596.<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> It must be added that the Theatre was not strictly
reserved for the purposes of the legitimate drama. It was built for
‘activities’, amongst other things, according to Stowe, and prizes of
the School of Defence were played at it between 1578 and 1585.<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> On
22 February 1582, there took place at the Theatre ‘a scurvie play set
oot al by one virgin, which there proved a fyemarten without voice, so
that we stayed not the matter’.<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></p>

<p>It was a natural consequence of the success of Burbadge’s new departure
that the Theatre and its immediate successor, the Curtain, had to bear
the brunt of the Puritan denunciations of the stage. These incidentally
bore witness to the costly elaborateness of the new accommodation
provided for the players.<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> Apart from the moral corruption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span> upon
which the Puritans laid most stress, there is some evidence that the
position of the Theatre, with a great space of open ground before it,
made it a natural focus for the disorderly elements of society. As
early as 5 October 1577, just after the resumption of plays for the
autumn, the Mayor and Recorder Fleetwood were listening to ‘a brabell
betwene John Wotton and the Leuetenuntes sonne of the one parte, and
certain ffreholders of Shordyche, for a matter at the Theater’. There
was serious trouble in the course of 1584. Fleetwood wrote to Burghley
how on 8 June, ‘very nere the Theatre or Curten, at the tyme of the
playes, there laye a prentice sleping upon the grasse and one Challes
<i>alias</i> Grostock dyd turne upon the too upon the belly of the same
prentice; whereupon the apprentice start up, and after wordes they
fell to playne bloues’; and how on 10 June, ‘one Browne, a serving man
in a blew coat, a shifting fellowe, having a perrelous witt of his
owne, entending a spoile if he cold have browght it to passe, did at
Theatre doore querell with certen poore boyes, handicraft prentises,
and strooke some of theym; and lastlie he with his sword wondend and
maymed one of the boyes upon the left hand; whereupon there assembled
nere a ml. people’.<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> Unscrupulous characters might find congenial
companions in the throng. Somewhere in 1594 a diamond, which had gone
astray from the loot of a Spanish vessel, was shown in Finsbury Fields
by a mariner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span> to certain goldsmiths, who said that they had met him
by chance at a play in the Theatre at Shoreditch.<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> But James
Burbadge had obtained for himself a tactical advantage by building
outside the jurisdiction of the City and within that, less organized
or more easy-going, of the Middlesex magistrates. The Corporation were
powerless, except in so far as, directly by persuasion, or indirectly
by invoking the Privy Council, they could stir the county bench to
action. They lost no opportunity, which brawls or plague afforded, of
attempting this.<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> An exceptionally troublous year was 1580. It
began with an indictment of John Brayne and James Burbadge ‘yeomen’ of
Shoreditch, at the Middlesex sessions, for bringing unlawful assemblies
together on 21 February and other days ‘<i>ad audienda et spectanda
quaedam colloquia sive interluda vocata</i> playes or interludes’ by
them and others ‘<i>exercitata et practicata</i>’ at the Theatre in
Holywell, with the result of affrays and tumults leading to a breach
of the peace.<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> On 6 April was the great earthquake, which threw
down chimneys in Shoreditch, and according to one account ‘shaked not
only the scenical Theatre, but the great stage and theatre of the whole
land’.<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> Four days later was the riot between Lord Oxford’s men and
the Inns of Court, and the two events gave the Lord Mayor an excellent
opportunity of pointing out to the Council that the players of plays
which were used at the Theatre were ‘a very superfluous sort of men’
and of securing a suspension of performances until after Michaelmas.
The riot of 8 June 1584 similarly led to the inhibition by the Council
and Fleetwood already noticed, although it is clear that this was not
so permanent as the City probably hoped, when the authority for ‘the
suppressing and pulling downe of the Theatre and Curten’ reached them.
Matters came to a crisis again in 1597 with the production of <i>The
Isle of Dogs</i> on the Bankside, and an appeal of the City on 28 July
was answered on the same day by mandates of the Council, of which one
was addressed to the Middlesex justices, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span> directed them to send for
the owners of the Theatre and Curtain, and enjoin them to ‘plucke downe
quite the stages, gallories and roomes that are made for people to
stand in, and so to deface the same as they maie not be ymploied agayne
to suche use’.<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a></p>

<p>It is unlikely that the Theatre was ever opened again. It is certain
that the Chamberlain’s men had moved to the Curtain before the end of
1597, and the abandonment of the old house is referred to unmistakably
enough in a satire published in 1598.<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> The explanation is to be
found in the relations of the Burbadges to their ground landlord,
Giles Allen. The following account is taken in the main from Cuthbert
Burbadge’s allegations in litigation of 1600. On 1 November 1585,
shortly before the termination of the first ten years of the lease,
James Burbadge, as he was entitled to do, presented Allen with a draft
of a new twenty-one years’ lease. This Allen evaded signing, apparently
alleging that it was not in verbatim agreement with the old lease, and
probably also that some of Burbadge’s covenants under the old lease
had remained unfulfilled.<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> By way of precaution, Burbadge thought
it desirable to put on record in his account-book some evidence that
he had spent the £200 in improving the tenements, upon which his right
to remove the structure of the Theatre depended. He called in expert
craftsmen, and took two ‘views’, one on 20 November 1585, another,
after some further work had been done, on 18 July 1586. The first
estimate was £220, the second £240. This last was later confirmed by
a third view taken in connexion with the Brayne litigation in July
1591.<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> The money had been spent, partly on ordinary repairs,
partly on converting the old barn into tenements, partly on putting up
two new houses, one of which was for Burbadge’s own occupation.<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>
The matter of the new lease now slumbered until the expiration of the
old one on 13 April 1597 drew near. In 1596 negotiations took place
between landlord and tenant, and a compromise was mooted, by which
the new lease was to be granted, but for an increased rent of £24
instead of £14. Allen afterwards asserted and Cuthbert Burbadge denied
that there was a proviso that after five years the building should be
converted to some other use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span> than that of a play-house.<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> Cuthbert
continued the negotiations after James Burbadge’s death in February
1597, but they finally broke down, and for a year or so the tenancy
was only on sufferance.<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> Finally, in the autumn of 1598, when
Cuthbert had agreed to demands which he thought extortionate, Allen
refused to accept his brother Richard as security, and all hope of a
settlement disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> Cuthbert now resolved to avail himself
of the covenant of the expired lease, under which the tenant was
entitled to pull down and remove the Theatre. This he began to do, in
spite of a protest from Allen’s representative, on 28 December 1598,
with the concurrence of his mother and brother, and the financial
aid of one William Smith of Waltham Cross.<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> The work was still
in progress on 20 January 1599, when Burbadge’s agent, Peter Street,
carpenter, entered the close with ten or twelve men, and carried the
timber to the other side of the river for use in the erection of the
Globe. For this act Allen brought an action of trespass against Street
in the Queen’s Bench, alleging that he had trampled down grass in
the close to the value of 40<i>s.</i>, and claiming damages for £800
in all, of which £700 represented his estimate of the value of the
Theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> Burbadge applied to the Court of Requests to stop the
common law suit, alleging in effect that he was equitably entitled to
act upon the covenant, even though the lease had expired, on account of
the unreasonable refusal of Allen to grant the new lease when applied
for, under the terms of the old one, in 1585.<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> The issue really
turned upon whether this refusal was reasonable. Allen said that
James Burbadge had been a troublesome tenant, that he had converted
the barn into eleven tenements, whose inhabitants became a nuisance
to the parish by begging for their 20<i>s.</i> rents, that he had not
repaired the building but only shored it up, that he had not spent the
stipulated £200, and that £30 rent was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span> arrear at the time of the
application of 1585 and was still unpaid.<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> Probably these last two
were the only allegations to which the court attached importance. Allen
claimed that he had no remedy against James Burbadge’s estate, for he
had made deeds of gift to his sons of his property, and his widow and
administratrix was without funds. Burbadge, however, produced evidence
of the estimates of 1585 and 1586, and suggested that his father had a
counter-claim against the rent in the expense to which he had been put
in maintaining his possession at the time of Peckham’s claim to the
freehold. On 18 October 1600 the Court decided in his favour.<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>
Allen brought a Queen’s Bench action against him in 1601 for breach of
agreement, and in 1601 complained to the Star Chamber of perjury on the
part of the expert witnesses and other wrongs done him in the course of
the earlier proceedings; but, although the conclusions of these suits
are not on record, it is not likely that he succeeded in obtaining a
favourable decision.<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a></p>


<h5>vii. THE CURTAIN</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;Some rather scanty material is
brought together by T. E. Tomlins, <i>Origin of the Curtain
Theatre and Mistakes regarding it</i> in <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>,
i. 29, and Halliwell-Phillipps, <i>The Theatre and Curtain</i>
(<i>Outlines</i>, i. 345).]</p>
</div>

<p>The Curtain is included with the Theatre in Stowe’s general description
of Holywell as ‘standing on the South-west side towards the field’.
That it was somewhat south of the Theatre is indicated by a reference
to it in 1601 as in Moorfields, a name given to the open fields lying
south of and adjacent to Finsbury Fields. But, although it stood in
the parish of Shoreditch and the liberty of Holywell, it was not, like
the Theatre, actually within the precinct of the dissolved priory.
<i>Curtina</i> is glossed by Ducange as ‘<i>minor curtis, seu rustica
area, quae muris cingitur</i>’, and the description is sufficiently met
by the piece of land lying outside the southern gate of the priory, and
on the other side of Holywell Lane into which that gate opened.<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>
A priory lease to the Earl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span> of Rutland of his town house in 1538
described it as ‘<i>infra muros et portas eiusdem monasterii</i>’, and
part of the holding consisted of stables and a hay-loft ‘<i>scituata
et existentia extra portas eiusdem monasterii prope pasturam dictae
Priorissae vocatam</i> the Curtene’. Post-dissolution conveyances refer
to a ‘house, tenement or lodge’ called the Curtain, and to a parcel of
ground, enclosed with a wall on the west and north, called the Curtain
close, which lay south of the Earl of Rutland’s house, and on which
by 1581 stood various tenements, which were described as ‘sett, lyeng
and being in Halliwell Lane’. The property in question formed part of
the possessions of Sir Thomas Leigh of Hoxton at his death in 1543 and
had formerly been conveyed to him by Lord Wriothesley. Through Leigh’s
daughter Katharine it passed to her husband Lord Mountjoy. On 20
February 1567 it was sold for £40 to Maurice Long and his son William,
being then in the occupation of one Wilkingeson and Robert Manne. On
23 August 1571 Maurice Long conveyed it for £200 to Sir William Allen,
then Lord Mayor, possibly by way of mortgage in connexion with building
speculations, since on 18 March 1581 it was in the hands of William
Long, who then sold it to Thomas Herbert. There had evidently been an
increase in the number of tenements on the site, and Thomas Wilkinson,
Thomas Wilkins, Robert Medley, Richard Hicks, Henry Lanman, and Robert
Manne are named as tenants.<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> As Henry Lanman or Laneman had the
profits of the theatre in 1585, there can be little doubt that it stood
on part of the land dealt with in the conveyances. Halliwell-Phillipps
thinks that it must have been situated ‘in or near the place which
is marked as Curtain Court in Chassereau’s plan of Shoreditch,
1745’,<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> and is now known as Gloucester Street. If so, it was very
near the boundary between Holywell and Moorfields, much along the line
of which now runs Curtain Road. But it must be remembered that Curtain
Court may also have taken its name from the ‘house, tenement or lodge’
which already existed in 1567 and is mentioned as the Curtain House in
the Shoreditch registers as late as 1639; and certainly in Ryther’s map
(<i>c.</i> 1636–45) the theatre, though still bordering on Moorfields,
is shown a good deal farther,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span> both to the east and the south, than the
point indicated by Halliwell-Phillipps.<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a></p>

<p>The Burbadges claimed that James was the first builder of play-houses,
but the Curtain must have followed very soon after the Theatre. It is
not mentioned by name with its predecessor in the Privy Council order
of 1 August 1577, but is in Northbrooke’s treatise of the following
December. Up to 1597 its history is little more than a pendant to that
of the Theatre, with which it is generally coupled in the Puritan
attacks and in the occasional interferences of authority. From 1585 to
1592, indeed, it was used as an ‘easer’ to the Theatre, and the profits
of the two houses were pooled under an arrangement between Henry
Lanman and the Burbadges.<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> The companies who occupied the Curtain
can for the most part only be guessed at.<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> At the time of the
inhibition of 14 June 1584 it was probably occupied by Lord Arundel’s
men. Tarlton appeared at it, but not necessarily after the formation
of the Queen’s company.<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> Prizes of the School of Defence were
occasionally played at it from 1579 to 1583.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> Unlike the Theatre,
the Curtain was certainly reopened after the inhibition of 1597. It is
likely that the Chamberlain’s men repaired to it in October of that
year, and remained at it until the Globe was ready in 1599. The same
satirist, who tells us that the Theatre was closed in 1598, tells us
that the Rose, which was continuously occupied by the Admiral’s men,
and the Curtain were open;<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span> a clue to the actors at it is
given by Marston’s reference to ‘Curtain plaudities’ in the closest
connexion with <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> In 1600 Robert Armin, of
the Chamberlain’s men, published his <i>Fool upon Fool</i>, in which he
called himself ‘Clonnico de Curtanio Snuffe’. In the 1605 edition he
changed the name to ‘Clonnico del Mondo Snuffe’. The direct connexion
of the Chamberlain’s men with the Curtain probably ended on the opening
of the Globe. But a share in it belonged to Thomas Pope, when he made
his will on 22 July 1603, and another to John Underwood, when he made
his on 4 October 1624. Both were of the Chamberlain’s men, although
Underwood cannot have joined them until about 1608.</p>

<p>The Curtain did not go entirely out of use when the Chamberlain’s left
it. It must have been the theatre near Bishopsgate at which Thomas
Platter saw a play in September or October 1599.<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> It is possible
that Kempe (q.v.) was then playing there. In March 1600 one William
Hawkins, barber, of St. Giles’s without Cripplegate was charged at the
Middlesex Sessions with taking a purse and £1 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> at
the Curtain, and Richard Fletcher, pewterer, of Norwich, was bound over
to give evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p>On 22 June 1600, when the Privy Council gave authority for the opening
of the Fortune, they were given to understand by the Master of the
Revels that it would replace the Curtain, which was therefore to be
‘ruinated or applied to some other good use’. This arrangement seems to
suggest that the Curtain was in some way under the control of Alleyn or
Henslowe. It was, however, departed from, and apparently with the tacit
consent of the Council, as although they had occasion on 10 May 1601 to
instruct the Middlesex justices to suppress a libellous play produced
at ‘the Curtaine in Moorefeilds’, they did not take, as they might
have done, the point that no play ought to have been produced there
at all. On 31 December they were again insisting on the limitation of
the theatres in use to two; and on 31 March 1602 they again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span> departed
from their own principles by licensing Oxford’s and Worcester’s men to
play at the Boar’s Head. Henceforward three companies of men players
were regularly tolerated, and when a draft licence was prepared for
Worcester’s, or as they had then become Queen Anne’s, men early in the
following year the Curtain and the Boar’s Head were named as ‘there now
usuall howsen’. The Curtain is also specified for them in the Council’s
warrant for the resumption of plays on 9 April 1604. About 1606 they
also took into use the Red Bull, and thereafter but little is heard
of the Curtain. The Queen’s men, however, played Day, Wilkins, and
Rowley’s <i>The Travels of Three English Brothers</i> there at some
time before its entry on 29 June 1607. It was still theirs in April
1609, but may perhaps soon have passed to the Duke of York’s men. It
is mentioned, with the Globe and Fortune, in Heath’s <i>Epigrams</i>
of 1610, and plays heard ‘at <i>Curtaine</i>, or at Bull’ and ‘a
Curtaine Iigge’ are objects of ridicule in Wither’s <i>Abuses Stript
and Whipt</i> of 1613.<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> It was used by an amateur company for a
performance of Wentworth Smith’s <i>Hector of Germany</i> in 1615, and
it is obscurely referred to in I. H.’s <i>This World’s Folly</i> of the
same year.<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> Malone gathered from Sir Henry Herbert’s office-book
that it was used by Prince Charles’s men in 1622, and soon thereafter
only by prize-fighters. It was still in use in 1624, and still standing
in 1627.<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a></p>


<h5>viii. NEWINGTON BUTTS</h5>

<p>A theatre, of which the history is very obscure, but which may have
been built soon after the Theatre and Curtain, stood at Newington, a
village one mile from London Bridge, divided from the Bankside by St.
George’s Fields, and reachable by the road which continued Southwark
High Street.<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> Here there were butts for the practice of archery.
Plays at Newington Butts, outside the City jurisdiction, are first
mentioned in a Privy Council letter of 13 May 1580 to the Surrey
justices. A similar letter of 11 May 1586 speaks more precisely of
‘the theater or anie other places about Newington’. A third letter,
undated, but probably belonging to 1591 or 1592, recites an order
of the Council restraining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span> Strange’s men from playing at the Rose,
and enjoining them to play three days a week at Newington Butts, and
rescinds it, ‘by reason of the tediousness of the way, and that of long
time plays have not there been used on working days’.<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> Possibly
the theatre had come into Henslowe’s hands, for his diary records that
it was at Newington that the combined companies of the Admiral’s and
Chamberlain’s men began their first season after the plague of 1592–4,
apparently playing there from 5 to 15 June 1594, and then going their
separate ways to the Rose and the Theatre respectively. The theatre is
mentioned in the list given by Howes in 1631.<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> It is said to have
been ‘only a memory’ by 1599.<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> A bad pun is called a ‘Newington
conceit’ in 1612.<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a></p>


<h5>ix. THE ROSE</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;All the more important documents
are printed or calendared from the <i>Dulwich MSS.</i> with
a valuable commentary in Greg, <i>Henslowe’s Diary</i> and
<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, and in Collier, <i>Memoirs of Alleyn</i>
and <i>Henslowe’s Diary</i>.]</p>
</div>

<p>The Rose owed its name to the fact that it stood in what had been, as
recently as 1547–8, a rose garden.<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> On 3 December 1552 Thomasyn,
widow of Ralph Symonds, fishmonger, granted to trustees, for her own
use during life and thereafter to the charitable uses of the parish of
St. Mildred, Bread Street, her ‘messuage or tennement then called the
little rose with twoe gardens’ formerly in St. Margaret’s and then in
St. Saviour’s, Southwark. St. Mildred’s still has a plan of the estate,
which extended to about three roods.<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> A ‘tenement called the Rose’
is referred to in a recital of a lease of Henry VIII’s reign as the
eastern boundary of other tenements, by name the Barge, the Bell, and
the Cock, which lay ‘vppon the banke called Stewes’ in St. Margaret’s,
afterwards St. Saviour’s, parish, between the highway next the Thames
on the north and Maiden Lane on the south.<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> It is located by
Mr. Rendle just to the east of the still existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span> Rose Alley. The
site therefore lay in the Liberty of the Clink midway between those
afterwards occupied by the Globe on the east and the Hope on the
west. On 20 November 1574 the parish let the property for thirty-one
years at £7 annually to William Griffin, vintner. Griffin assigned
it on 11 December 1579 to Robert Withens, vintner, and Withens on 24
March 1585 to Henslowe.<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> There was as yet no theatre. The first
mention of one as in contemplation is in an agreement of 10 January
1587 between Henslowe and one John Cholmley, citizen and grocer of
London, for partnership during the next eight years and three months,
should both parties live so long, in a garden plot ninety-four feet
square on the Bankside in the parish of St. Saviour’s, Southwark, and
‘a playe howse now in framinge and shortly to be ereckted and sett vppe
vpone the same’. Under this Henslowe undertook to have ‘the saide play
house with all furniture thervnto belonginge’ set up ‘with as muche
expedicion as maye be’ by John Grigges, carpenter, to pay all rents due
on the premisses, and to repair the bridges and wharves belonging to
them before the following Michaelmas. Cholmley undertook to bear his
share of any further cost of maintaining the premises, and also to pay
Henslowe the sum of £816 in quarterly instalments. In consideration of
this, he was to take half of all such profits as ‘shall arysse grow be
colectted gathered or become due for the saide parcell of grounde and
playe howse when and after yt shalbe ereckted and sett vpe by reason of
any playe or playes, that shalbe showen or played there or otherwysse
howsoever’. The partners are jointly to appoint ‘players to vse
exersyse &amp; playe in the saide playe howse’, and collect sums themselves
or by deputy of all persons coming to the performances ‘excepte yt
please any of the saide partyes to suffer theire frendes to go in for
nothinge’. Cholmley is also to have the sole right of selling food or
drink on the premises and a small house already in his tenure on the
south of the plot close to Maiden Lane, ‘to keepe victualinge in’ or
for any other purpose, and with a right of ingress from Thames side by
Rose Alley.<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> The deed does not name the property, but it cannot
be doubted that it refers to a part of the Little Rose. Presumably the
theatre was to be built on a garden at the back of the holding, and the
existing tenement on Bankside was not to be interfered with. Henslowe
had ‘Rosse rentes’ of a residential character in 1602 or 1603.<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a>
Norden’s map (1593) puts the Rose farther from the river than the Bear
Garden. The Delaram and Merian drawings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span> on the other hand, put it
very near the river, and these, although of less authority than Norden,
are followed in Mr. Rendle’s plan. Probably Norden’s Bear Garden was
an older one than that which afterwards became the Hope.<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> The
provision as to the wharfs and bridges seems to indicate an intention
to open the Rose at Michaelmas 1587, and I see no reason to doubt
that it was in fact ready for occupation by about that date. On 29
October the Privy Council called the attention of the Surrey justices
to complaints from Southwark of breaches of the rule against plays on
Sunday, ‘especiallie within the Libertie of the Clincke and in the
parish of St. Saviour’s in Southwarke’. There may, of course, have been
plays at inns in the Clink, but it is more natural to take the protest
as one against the newly opened Rose. No other regular theatre existed
in the Clink at this time. That the Rose was built by 1588 appears from
a record of the Sewer Commission for Surrey.<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> It is not in Smith’s
plan of 1588, but this may easily not have been quite up to date.</p>

<p>The next that is heard of the Rose is probably in 1592.<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> In March
and April of that year Henslowe, who had recently taken his famous
‘diary’ into use as a financial memorandum book, noted in it some
building expenditure, and a little later set out ‘a note of suche
carges as I haue layd owt a bowte my playe howsse in the yeare of our
lord 1592’.<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> Henslowe is not known to have owned Newington Butts,
or any other theatre except the Rose, and it is reasonable to assume
that this is what he meant by ‘my playe howsse’. The work probably
began in or before January, as an entry halfway through the list is
dated on 6 February. It entailed the purchase of a barge and a certain
amount of breaking up and paling and wharfing. Henslowe appears to have
done the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span> work himself and not by contract. He bought a mast, turned
balusters, boards and laths, in part from the carpenter Grigges who is
named in the agreement with Cholmley, and in part from a ‘timber man’
called Lee. He bought bolts, hinges, and nails from the ironmonger at
the Fryingpan in Southwark and from one Brader. He bought lime, sand,
chalk, and bricks. He paid wages to carpenters, workmen, and labourers,
and employed painters and a thatcher. The exact nature and extent of
the work are not specified, but it included the painting of the stage,
the ceiling of ‘my lords rome’, and ‘the rome ouer the tyerhowsse’, and
the ‘makeinge the penthowsse shed at the tyeringe howsse doore’. It has
sometimes been supposed that the Rose never got built in 1587, and that
these are the accounts, or part of them, for the original construction.
This seems to me most unlikely. The total expense, with the exception
of a small number of items lost by the mutilation of a page, only
amounted to about £108. This could not cover more than repairs. On
the other hand, these were clearly substantial repairs, and the fact
that they were needed suggests that the building cannot have been a
very new one. The lapse of five years since 1587 would, however, be
consistent with the necessity for them. Almost simultaneously with the
earliest dated entries in the building account, begins on 19 February
1592 the record of performances by Lord Strange’s men, which continues
to the following 22 June. If these were at the Rose, the paint on the
stage can hardly have been dry in time for them, unless, as Dr. Greg
suggests, the payments made in March and April were for work done a
little earlier. That it was at the Rose that Strange’s men played
seems indicated by the Privy Council order, reciting the restraint of
this company ‘from playinge at the Rose on the Banckside’, which it
is difficult to assign to any year but 1591 or 1592.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> It is a
little curious that nothing more is heard of John Cholmley, and I think
the natural inference is that he was dead and that the partnership
had thereby, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, been
automatically dissolved.<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<p>The assumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that until
he acquired a share in the Fortune Henslowe had no proprietary interest
in any other theatre must explain the assignment to the Rose of all
the playing recorded in the diary between 1592 and the autumn of 1600,
with the exception of the few performances definitely stated to have
been at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span> Newington Butts. The further conjecture must, I think, be
accepted that the season begun by the Admiral’s and Chamberlain’s men
at Newington Butts in the summer of 1594 was transferred, so far as the
Admiral’s men were concerned, to the Rose after 15 June. If so, the
Rose housed Strange’s men again from 29 December 1592 to 1 February
1593, Sussex’s from 26 December 1593 to 6 February 1594, the Queen’s
and Sussex’s together from 1 to 9 April 1594, and the Admiral’s from 14
to 16 May 1594, and then regularly from the following June until their
transference to the Fortune in 1600. The only actual mentions of the
theatre by name in the diary during this period are in the agreements
of 1597 between Henslowe and the players Jones and Borne, in which
Henslowe specifies ‘the Rosse’ as ‘my howsse’ in which they are to
play. It was no doubt in use when Guilpin’s <i>Skialetheia</i> (S. R.
8 September 1598) was written.<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> In the Lenten interval of 1595
Henslowe made ‘A nott of what I haue layd owt abowt my playhowsse ffor
payntynge &amp; doinge it abowt with ealme bordes &amp; other repracyones’. The
expenditure reached a total of £108 19<i>s.</i>, which was much about
the same as that of 1592, and was supplemented in the following June
by a further £7 2<i>s.</i> for carpenters’ work, including ‘mackinge
the throne in the heuenes’.<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> The accounts of 1592 and 1595 suggest
that the building was of wood and plaster on a brick foundation, and
this is consistent with Hentzner’s statement of 1598. Part of it, at
least, was thatched. If the maps can be trusted, it was octagonal. In
1600 Henslowe had to find new occupants for the Rose. He records that
Pembroke’s men began to play there on 28 October, but only enters two
unprofitable performances. Possibly the Privy Council, who had decreed
in the previous July a limitation of houses to one on each side of the
river, interfered. But this limitation was certainly not permanent.
There is a receipt for a play bought for Worcester’s men ‘at the Rose’,
and they probably used the house during the term of their account with
Henslowe between August 1602 and May 1603. Subsequently they moved
to the Curtain and Boar’s Head. Henslowe’s lease of the site was due
to expire at the end of 1605, and this explains to some extent the
following entry in the diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The 25 of June 1603 I talked with M<sup>r</sup>. Pope at the scryveners
shope wher he lisse consernynge the tackynge of the leace a new
of the littell Roosse &amp; he showed me a wrytynge betwext the
pareshe &amp; hime seallfe which was to paye twenty pownd a yeare
rent &amp; to bestowe a hundred marckes vpon billdinge which I sayd
I wold rather pulle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span> downe the playehowse then I wold do so &amp; he
beade me do &amp; sayd he gaue me leaue &amp; wold beare me owt for yt
wasse in him to do yt.’<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is impossible to say whether ‘Mr. Pope’ was Thomas Pope of the
King’s men at the neighbouring Globe, or Morgan Pope, who was formerly
interested in the Bear House, or some other Pope; nor is it clear how
he was in a position to authorize Henslowe to pull down the theatre.
Dr. Greg draws the natural inference from the wording that he may have
given his consent as a prospective lessee of the property.<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> In
any case the Rose was not pulled down until two or three years later.
The Sewers records show that in January 1604 not Philip but Francis
Henslowe was amerced 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for it, which may mean that
Lennox’s men were playing there; that on 4 October 1605 Philip Henslowe
was amerced, but return was made that it was ‘out of his hands’; that
on 14 February 1606 Edward Box, of Bread Street, London, was amerced
for it; and that on 25 April 1606 Box was amerced for the site of ‘the
late play-house in Maid lane’.<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a></p>

<p>There is no record of plays at the Rose after 1603.<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> It is in
the Delaram engravings, but not in any later views except those of
the Merian group, where it appears, flagged but unnamed, on the river
edge.<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> Nor is it mentioned with the Hope, Globe, and Swan in
<i>Holland’s Leaguer</i> (1632). The explanation may perhaps be that
the Merian engraver followed some out-of-date authority, such as
Delaram, which had got the house farther north than Norden puts it, and
as it had long ceased to exist, did not know its name. On the other
hand, it is also just conceivable that for a short period the Rose, or
some other building at the north end of the Rose site, had a renewed
life as a place of public entertainment. Alleyn was paying ‘tithe dwe
for the Rose’ in 1622.<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> And Malone cites Herbert’s ‘office-book’
for a statement that after 1620 the Swan and the Rose were ‘used
occasionally for the exhibition of prize-fighters’.<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a></p>

Theatre</i> (<i>M. P.</i> ix. 431), discusses the light thrown
on the internal arrangements of the Swan by the accounts of
<i>England’s Joy</i> in 1602.]</p>
</div>

<p>The Swan stood in the Liberty and Manor of Paris Garden, at the western
end of the Bankside. This manor, from which the royal ‘game’ of
bear-baiting took its traditional appellation, had come into the hands
of the Crown as part of the possessions of the dissolved monastery
of Bermondsey. It was granted in 1578 to nominees of Henry, Lord
Hunsdon, conveyed by them to the Cure family, and sold for £850 on 24
May 1589 by Thomas Cure the younger to Francis Langley, a citizen and
goldsmith of London. Langley, who was brother-in-law to Sir Anthony
Ashley, one of the clerks to the Privy Council, held the office of
Alnager and Searcher of Cloth, to which he had been appointed by
the Corporation on the recommendation of the Privy Council and Sir
Francis Walsingham in December 1582.<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> The site of the theatre can
be precisely identified from a plan of the manor dated in 1627, but
based on a survey of 1 November 1624.<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> It was in the north-east
corner of the demesne, east of the manor-house, twenty-six poles due
south of Paris Garden stairs, and immediately west of a lane leading
to a house called Copt Hall. The outline shown is that of a double
circle, or perhaps dodecahedron, divided into twelve compartments,
with a small porch or tiring-house towards the road. The exact date
of building is unknown. On 3 November 1594 the Lord Mayor wrote to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
Burghley that Langley ‘intendeth to erect a niew stage or Theater
(as they call it) for the exercising of playes vpon the Banck side’,
and detailed the usual civic objections to the stage as arguments in
favour of the suppression of the project.<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> It is probable that
Burghley refused to intervene and that Langley proceeded at once with
the erection of the Swan, which may then have been ready for use in
1595. It is impossible, without the Swan, to make up the tale of four
‘spielhäuser’ seen by the Prince of Anhalt in 1596 (360). To 1596
again is assigned, although with probability rather than certainty,
the visit of John de Witt, who not only names but also describes and
delineates the Swan.<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> In any case the Swan had already been in
use by players before February 1597, when Langley entered into an
arrangement for its occupation by Lord Pembroke’s men.<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> The terms
of the lease provided that he should make the house ready and furnish
apparel, which he alleged cost him £300, and should get his return for
this expenditure out of the company’s moiety of the gallery takings,
in addition of course to the other moiety which in accordance with
theatrical custom went to him as rent.<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> The enterprise was rudely
interrupted by the production of <i>The Isle of Dogs</i> at the Swan
itself, and the restraint of 28 July 1597 which was the result. The
leading members of Pembroke’s company joined or rejoined the Admiral’s
at the Rose, and became involved in litigation with Langley on account
of their breach of covenant.<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> For a time Langley succeeded in
keeping a company together, and the Swan remained open.<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> It was
perhaps the intention of the Privy Council order of 19 February 1598,
against an intrusive ‘third company’ which was competing with the
Chamberlain’s and the Admiral’s, to close it.<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> If so, Langley may
still for a time have found means of evasion, since on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span> following
1 May the vestry of St. Saviour’s were viewing new buildings of his,
and at the same time negotiating with Henslowe and Meade for money for
the poor ‘in regarde of theire playe-houses’.<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> During the next few
years, however, such notices as we get of the Swan, while showing that
it was still in existence and available for occasional entertainments,
carry no evidence of any use by a regular company. Francis Meres, in
his <i>Palladis Tamia</i> of 1598, tells us that it was the scene of
a challenge in ‘extemporall’ versifying by Robert Wilson.<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> It
was one of the wooden theatres which were seen by Hentzner in the
same year, and no doubt the one near which he describes the royal
barge as lying.<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> On 15 May 1600 the Council sanctioned its use
for feats of activity by Peter Bromvill.<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> On 7 February 1602 it
was occupied by fencers, and while two of these, by names Turner and
Dun, were playing their prizes upon its stage, Dun was unfortunate
enough to receive a mortal wound in the eye.<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> On 6 November 1602
it was chosen by Richard Vennar for his impudent mystification of
<i>England’s Joy</i>. The accounts of this transaction show that it was
fitted with ‘hangings, curtains, chairs, and stools’, and capable of
scenic effects, such as the appearance of a throne of blessed souls in
heaven and of black and damned souls with fireworks from beneath the
stage.<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> Meanwhile Langley had died in 1601 and in January 1602
the Paris Garden estate was sold to Hugh Browker, a protonotary of
the Court of Common Pleas, in whose family it remained to 1655.<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a>
About 1611 it was once more taken into use for plays. <i>The Roaring
Girl</i> (1611), itself a Fortune play, has an allusion to a knight
who ‘lost his purse at the last new play i’ the Swan’,<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> and the
accounts of the overseers of Paris Garden contain entries of receipts
from ‘the play house’ or ‘the Swan’ in each April from 1611 to
1615.<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> The last entry is of so small an amount that it probably
only covered a fraction of a year, and I think the inference is that
the Swan was disused on the opening of the Hope in 1614.<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> If so,
it had probably been taken over by Henslowe for the use of the Lady
Elizabeth’s men, who came into existence in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span> 1611, and whose <i>Chaste
Maid in Cheapside</i> was published in 1630 as ‘often acted at the Swan
on the Bankeside’. The Hope itself was modelled structurally upon the
Swan. Its measurements were the same, and it had similar partitions
between the rooms and external staircases. Its heavens, however,
were to be supported without the help of posts from the stage, since
this had to be removable on days of bear-baiting. It is obviously
illegitimate to infer from this specification that the stage of the
Swan, which was not used for bear-baiting, was also removable. The
accounts of the overseers show one more payment from the ‘players’ in
1621, which perhaps supports the statement contained in one of Malone’s
notes from Sir Henry Herbert’s office-book, that after 1620 the Swan
was ‘used occasionally for the exhibition of prize-fighters’.<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a>
The theatre is marked ‘Old Play-house’ in the manor map of 1627. The
last notice of it is in <i>Holland’s Leaguer</i> (1632) as a famous
amphitheatre, which was ‘now fallen to decay, and like a dying swanne
hanging downe her head seemed to sing her own dierge’.<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a></p>

<p>Many of the maps of the Bankside do not extend far enough west to
take in the Swan. It is named and shown as an octagonal or decagonal
building by Visscher (1616) and in maps of the Merian group (1638), but
not by Hollar (1647).</p>


<h5>xi. THE GLOBE</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The devolution of the Globe
shares can be traced in the documents of three lawsuits:
(<i>a</i>) <i>Ostler v. Heminges</i>, in the Court of King’s
Bench in 1616 (<i>Coram Rege Roll</i> 1454, 13 Jac. I,
Hilary Term, m. 692), described by C. W. Wallace in <i>The
Times</i> of 2 and 4 Oct. 1909, and in part privately printed
by him in <i>Advance Sheets from Shakespeare, the Globe,
and Blackfriars</i> (1909), here cited as <i>O. v. H.</i>;
(<i>b</i>) <i>Witter v. Heminges and Condell</i>, in the Court
of Requests (1619–20), described by C. W. Wallace in <i>The

Chamberlain in 1635 known as the <i>Sharers Papers</i>,
and printed by Halliwell-Phillipps in <i>Outlines</i>, i.
312. Professor Wallace’s descriptive articles require some
corrections from the texts of his documents. Much evidence
bearing upon the site of the theatre was collected by W. Rendle
in <i>The Bankside, Southwark, and the Globe Play-house</i>
(1877), printed by the N. S. S. as an appendix to Harrison,
pt. ii (cited as Rendle, <i>Bankside</i>), in <i>Walford’s

the possession of the London County Council, and from deeds
concerning the Brend estate, were published by Dr. Wallace
in <i>The Times</i> of 30 April and 1 May 1914, and led to
discussion by Dr. Martin, Mr. Hubbard, and others in <i>11 N.

Site of the Globe Play-house</i> (1921). A paper by the present
writer on <i>The Stage of the Globe</i> is in the <i>Stratford
Town Shakespeare</i>, x. 351.]</p>
</div>

<p>In the building of the Globe use was made of the materials of the
old Theatre (q.v.) which, according to <i>Allen v. Burbadge</i>
(1602), the Burbadges, with Peter Street and others, pulled down on
28 December 1598, carried ‘all the wood and timber therof unto the
Banckside in the parishe of St. Marye Overyes, and there erected a newe
playehowse with the sayd timber and woode’.<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> An earlier account
gives the date of the audacious proceeding as 20 January 1599. The
formal lease of the new site from the freeholder, Nicholas Brend of
West Molesey, was executed on 21 February 1599. No doubt Street, who
had assisted in the transfer, was the builder and had finished his
job when on 8 January 1600 he contracted with Henslowe and Alleyn to
put up the Fortune (q.v.) on the model, with certain modifications,
of ‘the late erected plaiehowse on the Banck in the saide parishe of
St. Saviours called the Globe’. This contract allowed twenty-eight
weeks for the work. Probably the Globe took about the same time, for
it is described as ‘de novo edificata’ in the inquisition on the
property left by the lessor’s father, Thomas Brend, which is dated
on 16 May 1599.<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> It may not then have been quite finished, but
it was doubtless ready for the occupation of the Chamberlain’s men
by the beginning of the autumn season of 1599. One of the earliest
plays there produced by them was Shakespeare’s <i>Julius Caesar</i>
which on 21 September Thomas Platter crossed the water to see ‘in dem
streüwinen Dachhaus’.<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> Whether the Globe or its predecessor the
Curtain was the ‘wooden O’ of <i>Henry V</i>, 1, prol. 13, must be more
doubtful, as the prologue to Act V of the same play contemplates the
triumphant return of Essex from Ireland, and in fact Essex left England
on 27 March and returned, not triumphant, on 28 September 1599.<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a>
Jonson refers to ‘this faire-fild Globe’ as the scene of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span> his <i>Every
Man Out of his Humour</i>, produced in the autumn of 1600.<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> The
Privy Council order of the previous 22 June, which enacts that there
shall be one allowed house only ‘in Surrey in that place which is
commonlie called the Banckside or there aboutes’, goes on to recite
that the Chamberlain’s men had chosen the Globe to be that one. The
allowance of the house ‘in Surrey called the Globe’ is confirmed by
the Privy Council letter of 27 December 1601. The order of 9 April
1604 authorizes the opening after the plague of ‘the Globe scituate
in Maiden Lane on the Banckside in the Countie of Surrey’. This order
evidently contemplates that the King’s men will use the house, which
was assigned to them by name as ‘theire nowe vsual howse called the
Globe within our County of Surrey’ by the terms of the patent of 19
May 1603. The precedent is followed in the later patents of 1619 and
1625, and there is nothing to indicate that any other company than the
Chamberlain’s or King’s men ever performed, even temporarily, at the
theatre.</p>

<p>The Globe was held by a syndicate, composed mainly of members of
the company, on a leasehold tenure. The site, which had been garden
ground, was described in the original lease with some minuteness as
follows:<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">The lease was granted for a term of thirty-one years from Christmas
1598 to Christmas 1629, and conveyed the property in two equal
moieties, the one to Cuthbert and Richard Burbadge and the other to
William Shakespeare, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, John Heminges,
and William Kempe.<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> With the exception of Cuthbert Burbadge these
were all members of the Chamberlain’s company. Each moiety was charged
with a ground-rent of £7 5<i>s.</i> There is nothing to show how the
funds for building were found. ‘Wee’, said the Burbadges in 1635,
‘at like expence built the Globe, with more summes of money taken up
at interest, which lay heavy on us many yeeres; and to ourselves wee
joyned those deserveing men, Shakspere, Hemings, Condall, Philips, and
others, partners in the profittes of that they call the House, but
makeing the leases for twenty-one yeeres hath beene the destruction of
ourselves and others, for they dyeing at the expiration of three or
four yeeres of their lease, the subsequent yeeres became dissolved to
strangers, as by marrying with their widdowes and the like by their
children.’<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> This is, however, not a strictly accurate account
of what took place in 1599, for Condell was not one of the original
‘housekeepers’, and the original lease was for thirty-one, not
twenty-one, years. In any case, the Burbadges contributed the woodwork
of the Theatre.</p>

<p>Between the execution of the lease and the completion of the
play-house, Shakespeare and his four fellows assigned their moiety to
William Levison and Thomas Savage, who ‘reassigned to euerye of them
seuerally a fift parte of the said moitie’, so that after the building
each of the five had a ‘ioynt tenancie’ with the other four in a moiety
of the ground and galleries, and was also ‘tenant in common’ during the
term of the lease.<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> Professor Wallace explains that ‘the purpose
of a joint-tenancy was to prevent the breaking up and scattering of an
estate into fractions by keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span> the property always in the hands of
the members, or the longest survivors, or survivor, of them all, thus
not allowing it to descend to heirs’. The legal distinction is no doubt
sound, but we shall find that, whatever the intention of the assignment
and reassignment may have been, the Globe shares did in fact descend
to heirs, and that a good deal of trouble and litigation was thereby
caused.<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the house was built Kempe, no doubt on his withdrawal
from the company, assigned his interest to Shakespeare, Heminges, and
Phillips, who by further assignments to and from one Thomas Cressey
brought in Pope, with the result that each of the four now held a
fourth part of the moiety.<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> Pope died before 13 February 1604 and
left his interest to Mary Clark, <i>alias</i> Wood, and Thomas Bromley.
Mary Clark must have married John Edmonds, another legatee under the
will, for in 1612 an interest corresponding to Pope’s was held by
John and Mary Edmonds and Basil Nicoll.<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> Nicoll, who was Pope’s
executor, was presumably acting as trustee for Thomas Bromley. Edmonds,
though an actor, belonged not to the King’s men, but was a Queen’s
man by 1618. One-eighth of the house, therefore, was alienated from
the company in 1604. A further alienation, which proved particularly
troublesome in its results, took place on the death of Phillips in May
1605. The exact facts became a matter of legal dispute. But it appears
that Phillips’ interest passed first to his widow Anne as executrix,
and, when her marriage in the course of 1606 to the spendthrift John
Witter became known, to Heminges, who succeeded her as executor under
the terms of the will. In this capacity Heminges leased an interest
to the Witters on 14 February 1611 for a term of eighteen years from
Christmas 1610.<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> This interest was not a fourth, but only a sixth
of the moiety, since at some date between the death of Phillips and
that of Sly on 16 August 1608 the moiety had been redivided to allow of
the introduction of Henry Condell and William Sly into the syndicate
of housekeepers.<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> A similar transaction took place on 20 February
1612, when Basil Nicoll and John and Mary Edmonds, then holding
one-sixth of the moiety, Shakespeare and Witter, each also holding
one-sixth, and Heminges and Condell, holding three-sixths, joined to
convey one-seventh of the moiety to William Ostler.<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> It must,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span> I
think, be assumed that Heminges and Condell had together purchased the
share left by Sly to his son Robert.</p>

<p>The acquisition of the Blackfriars by the King’s men in 1608 did not,
at first at least, detract from the importance of the Globe as the
leading London theatre. It is so accepted by foreign visitors in 1610
and again in 1611.<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p>

<p>On 29 June 1613 the house was ‘casually burnt downe and consumed with
fier’.<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> The event was important enough to find a record in Howes’
continuation of Stowe’s <i>Annales</i>:<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Upon S. Peters day last, the play-house or Theater, called the
Globe, upon the Banckside near London, by negligent discharging
of a peal of ordinance, close to the south-side thereof, the
thatch took fire, and the wind sodainly disperst the flame round
about, and in a very short space the whole building was quite
consumed, and no man hurt; the house being filled with people to
behold the play, viz. of Henry the Eighth. And the next spring
it was new builded in far fairer manner than before.’</p>

<p class="p-left">Many other contemporary accounts exist. Thus Thomas

<p>‘No longer since than yesterday, while Burbage’s company were
acting at the Globe the play of Henry VIII, and there shooting
off certain chambers in way of triumph, the fire catched and
fastened upon the thatch of the house, and there burned so
furiously, as it consumed the whole house, all in less than two
hours, the people having enough to do to save themselves.’</p>

<p class="p-left">On 2 July Sir Henry Wotton wrote to his nephew Sir Edmund
Bacon:<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Now, to let matters of state sleep, I will entertain you at the
present with what has happened this week at the Bank’s side.
The King’s players had a new play, called <i>All is True</i>,
representing some principal pieces of the reign of Henry VIII,
which was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances
of pomp and majesty, even to the matting of the stage; the
Knights of the Order with their Georges and garters, the Guards
with their embroidered coats, and the like: sufficient in
truth within a while to make greatness very familiar, if not
ridiculous. Now, King Henry making a masque at the Cardinal
Wolsey’s house, and certain chambers being shot off at his
entry, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span> of the paper, or other stuff, wherewith one of them
was stopped, did light on the thatch, where being thought at
first but an idle smoke, and their eyes more attentive to the
show, it kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train, consuming
within less than an hour the whole house to the very grounds.
This was the fatal period of that virtuous fabric, wherein
yet nothing did perish but wood and straw, and a few forsaken
cloaks; only one man had his breeches set on fire, that would
perhaps have broiled him, if he had not by the benefit of a
provident wit put it out with bottle ale.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">On 8 July John Chamberlain wrote to Sir Ralph Winwood:<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The burning of the Globe, or play-house, on the Bankside, on
St. Peter’s day, cannot escape you; which fell out by a peal of
chambers (that I know not upon what occasion were to be used in
the play), the tamplin or stopple of one of them lighting in the
thatch that covered the house, burn’d it down to the ground in
less than two hours, with a dwelling-house adjoining, and it was
a great marvaile and fair grace of God, that the people had so
little harm, having but two narrow doors to get out.’</p>

<p class="p-left">Nor was poetic chronicles of the disaster lacking. On the day after the
fire took place, two ballads about it were entered in the Stationers’
Register.<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> Neither is known in print, but the use of the word
‘doleful’ suggests that one of them, of which the author was William
Parrat, is probably identical with the following set of verses,
preserved in manuscript:<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">The Puritans did in fact draw such morals as Jonson satirized. Prynne,
for example, finds the hand of God in ‘the sudden feareful burning,
even to the ground, both of the Globe and Fortune play-houses, no man
perceiving how these fires came’.<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>The Globe was at once rebuilt. It was open again by 30 June 1614,
when John Chamberlain wrote to Alice Carleton that he had called
upon her sister Williams, and found her ‘gone to the new Globe, to a
play. Indeed’, he says, ‘I hear much speech of this new play-house,
which is said to be the fairest that ever was in England, so that if
I live but seven years longer, I may chance to take a journey to see
it’.<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> The manuscript continuator of Stowe, describing the end
of the theatre, says that the rebuilding was ‘at the great charge
of King Iames, and many Noble men and others’.<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> The lawsuit
documents contain no indication that any part of the burden fell upon
any one but the ‘housekeepers’, who being bound under their lease to
‘mainteyne and repaire’ the house, resolved to ‘reedifie the same’.
The first estimate of cost seems to have been about £700 to £800, for
a levy of ‘50<sup>li</sup> or 60<sup>li</sup>’ was called upon each seventh share
of the moiety.<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> Witter was unable to meet this demand, and as
he was also behindhand with his share of the ground-rent and other
payments, Heminges resumed possession of the seventh and gave half of
it ‘gratis’ to Henry Condell. By this time it had been ascertained that
the re-edifying would be ‘a verie greate charge’, and Heminges claims
that the re-edifying of Witter’s ‘parte’ had in fact cost himself and
Condell ‘about the somme of cxx<sup>li</sup>’.<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> This would mean a total
cost of about £1,680.<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> Heminges appears to have taken a sub-lease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>
at 20<i>s.</i> a year from his partners of two small parcels of the
land in 1615, and to have built on them a house, probably a taphouse,
as a private enterprise.<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a></p>

<p>Ostler died in December 1614, and Heminges took possession of his
interest and drew the profits until October 1615, when his daughter
Thomasina, Ostler’s widow, brought an action against him for them, the
result of which is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> Shakespeare died in April 1616, and
his interest, if not previously alienated, would have passed under
his will, with other ‘leases’ to John and Susanna Hall.<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> At some
time earlier than April 1619, probably when he joined the company
about 1616, Field was admitted to be a housekeeper, and the moiety
was then divided into eighths instead of sevenths.<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> In April
1619 Witter brought an action against Heminges and Condell in the
Court of Requests, to recover the interest which he had forfeited at
the time of the rebuilding. He estimated the present annual value of
the seventh, which he had held, at £30 to £40, and in the course of
the proceedings expressed his willingness either to pay a rent of £13
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for the half of that seventh which Heminges had
not passed over to Condell, or, alternatively, to take the profits of
the houses on the site, other than the theatre, and in return for those
to become responsible for the whole of the ground-rents due under the
principal leases. The defence consisted in a denial of Witter’s claim
to benefit under the will of Augustine Phillips, and an assertion that,
after Heminges had allowed him to draw considerable sums in respect of
the share, he had deserted his wife, at whose death Heminges ‘out of
charitie was at the charges of the buryeing of her’. The depositions of
the witnesses, who included Thomas Woodford and one James Knasborough,
are unfortunately missing. Ultimately Witter failed to proceed with
his case, and on 29 November 1620 the Court gave judgement for the
defendants.</p>

<p>In October 1624 died John Underwood and left a share in the Globe in
trust for his children to Condell and others as his executors. It must
be supposed that he had succeeded to Field’s eighth, when the latter
left the King’s men in 1619. Condell himself died in December 1627
and left his interest to his son William until he should have made
£300 out of it, and thereafter to his widow. Heminges died in October
1630, and his interest passed to his son William as his executor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>
During the last years of their lives Heminges and Condell, following
out the policy of absorption which has already been illustrated,
appear to have acquired in one way or another the whole of the shares
formerly held by Shakespeare, by Basil Nicoll and John Edmonds as
successors of Sly, and by Underwood. This fact emerges from the records
known as the <i>Sharers Papers</i>, which start with a petition from
Robert Benfield, Eliard Swanston, and Thomas Pollard, then important
members of the King’s company, to the Lord Chamberlain in 1635, to
be admitted to shares as ‘housekeepers’ in the profits of the Globe
and the Blackfriars.<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> The allegations show that the Globe had
been ‘formerly’ divided into sixteen shares, of which eight were
held by Cuthbert Burbadge and Richard Burbadge’s widow Winifred, now
Mrs. Robinson, in her own right and that of her son William, four by
Mrs. Condell, and four by William Heminges. Afterwards Joseph Taylor
and John Lowin were allowed to acquire shares, and later still the
remaining Heminges interest was ‘surreptitiously’ purchased by John
Shank. At the date of the petition, therefore, the Burbadges held
seven shares, Mrs. Condell two, Shank three, and Taylor and Lowin two
each. The case furnishes valuable information as to the organization
of the theatre, and as to the division of outgoing and profits between
the housekeepers and the actors as such. It is pretty evident that
by 1635 the Globe took a secondary place to the Blackfriars in the
economy of the King’s men.<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> Shank admitted that he had bought
a two years’ term of one Globe share in 1633 and a one year’s term
of two more in 1634, together with interests in the Blackfriars, and
seems to have thought that the £506 which he gave was full value for
the purchases.<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> The Burbadges protested against being called upon
to part with any part of their property to ‘men soe soone shott up’
and not having the ‘antiquity and desert’, which had customarily been
looked for in housekeepers. In support of their plea they recalled
the early services of their father in the building of theatres and
the claims of their family to profit by ‘the great desert of Richard
Burbadge for his quality of playing’. They suggested that ‘makeing
the leases for twenty-one yeeres’ to their fellows, whose widows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span> or
children subsequently alienated the profits from the company, had been
their ‘destruction’. The Lord Chamberlain, however, directed that
the Burbadges should transfer two shares and Shank one to the three
petitioners, ‘at the usual and accustomed rates, and according to the
proportion of the time and benefit they are to injoy’. This the order
states, in the case of the Globe, as five years. Probably there is an
error here. The terms bought by Shank were to expire in 1635, but at
the time of the petition a suit was pending in the Court of Requests
for the confirmation of a ‘lease paroll’ from Sir Matthew Brend for
a further nine years from 25 March 1635. The original lease of 1599
from Nicholas Brend was for thirty-one years and would have expired in
1629. But on 26 October 1613, when the rebuilding of the theatre was
in hand, a fresh lease extending the term to 1635 had been granted by
Sir John Bodley as trustee for Nicholas’s son Matthew, who was then a
minor. Not content with this, the syndicate had procured a promise of
a further extension to 1644 from young Matthew himself, which he now
repudiated.<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> I think that Bodley must have taken the opportunity
in 1613 to raise the ground-rent from £14 10<i>s.</i> to £20. A draft
for a return of new and divided houses, made for the Earl Marshal in
1634, has the following entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The Globe play-house nere Maid lane built by the company of
players, with the dwelling-house thereto adjoyninge, built with
timber, about 20 yeares past, upon an old foundation, worth
14<sup>li</sup> to 20<sup>li</sup> per ann., and one house there adjoyning
built about the same tyme with timber, in the possession of
W<sup>m</sup> Millet, gent., worth per ann. 4<sup>li</sup> [<i>In margin</i>,
Play-house &amp; house, S<sup>r</sup> Mathew Brend’s inheritance].’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">A corrected return of 1637 runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The Globe play-house nere Maide lane built by the Company
of Players with timber about 20 yeares past uppon an old

Mathew Brand, K<sup>nt</sup>.’<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The petitioners in the <i>Sharers Papers</i> declare that up to Lady
Day 1635 the rent for the Globe and Blackfriars together was not above
£65. The original rent of the Blackfriars was £40, but this also may
have been put up on the expiration of the first lease in 1629. The
Court of Requests finally confirmed the extension of the lease to
1644, apparently at a still further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span> increased rent of £55, as Shank
states the combined rent of the two houses as £100. The Globe was
‘pulled downe to the ground, by Sir Matthew Brand, on Munday the 15
of April 1644, to make tenements in the room of it’; that is to say,
immediately upon the expiration of the nine years’ term from Lady Day
1635 contemplated in the <i>Sharers Papers</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a></p>

<p>The precise locality of the Globe has been matter of controversy. The
various contemporary documents already quoted place it beyond doubt in
Surrey, and ‘on the Bankside’, a term which must certainly be taken to
cover, not merely the row of houses looking directly upon the river,
but also the whole of the western part of Southwark lying behind and
south of these. With somewhat greater minuteness, the parish of St.
Mary Overies is specified in the lawsuit of <i>Allen v. Burbadge</i>,
and the parish of St. Saviour’s in the Fortune contract. There is no
inconsistency here. The two ancient parishes of St. Mary Magdalen
and St. Margaret on the Hill were amalgamated under the name of St.
Saviour’s at the Reformation.<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> I do not know that the ancient
boundaries are upon record. The Rose stood in what had been St.
Margaret’s, and one would therefore expect to find the Globe nearer
than the Rose to the old priory church of St. Mary’s. In the Privy
Council order of 1604 the situation is described as ‘in Maiden lane’,
and in the return to the Earl Marshal of 1637 as ‘nere Maide lane’.
But, apart from the difference between ‘in’ and ‘nere’, Maiden Lane
is a fairly long thoroughfare, and so far as these indications are
concerned, the Globe may have been either to the north or the south of
it. Local tradition, as elaborated by Southwark antiquaries, has been
inclined to put it to the south, within the area occupied by what was
formerly Thrale’s and is now Barclay and Perkins’s Anchor Brewery, of
which Maiden Lane, now Park Street, forms the northern boundary. The
main reason for this is the inclusion within the brewery of the course
of a passage known as Globe Alley, which ran west from Deadman’s Place
in a parallel line to Maiden Lane for about 360 feet and then turned
northwards for another 100 feet until it debouched into the Lane. So
far as measurements go, Globe Alley might be the <i>venella</i> of the
1599 lease. The name first appears in the St. Saviour’s token book
for 1614, where it is applied to houses formerly described as Brand’s
Rents, and from 1613 onwards as Sir John Bodley’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span> Rents.<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> Land
south of Maiden Lane certainly formed part of the Brend estate, and
a plot of it conveyed by Sir Matthew Brend to one Hilary Memprise in
1626 was bounded on the south by a sewer dividing it from the Bishop
of Winchester’s park, and on the north by ‘the alley or way leading to
the Gloabe Play-house commonly called Gloabe Alley’.<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> A century
later, property acquired for the brewery in 1732 is similarly described
as ‘fronting a certain alley or passage called Globe Alley, in antient
times leading from Deadman’s Place to the Globe Play-house’.<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a></p>

<p>It was certainly a belief in the Thrale family that the site of the
theatre itself had passed into their hands. Mrs. Piozzi, Johnson’s
friend, who married Henry Thrale in 1763, left the following
autobiographical note of her residence in Southwark between that date
and her husband’s death in 1781:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘For a long time, then&mdash;or I thought it such&mdash;my fate was bound
up with the old Globe Theatre, upon the Bankside, Southwark;
the alley it had occupied having been purchased and thrown down
by M<sup>r</sup> Thrale to make an opening before the windows of our
dwelling-house. When it lay desolate in a black heap of rubbish,
my Mother, one day, in a joke, called it the Ruins of Palmyra;
and after that they laid it down in a grass-plot. Palmyra was
the name it went by, I suppose, among the clerks and servants of
the brewhouse.... But there were really curious remains of the
old Globe Play-house, which though hexagonal in form without,
was round within.’<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Dr. Martin seems to think that the lady’s recollection was confused and
that the garden called Palmyra stood on the east of Deadman’s Place
opposite to Globe Alley. But, according to Concanen and Morgan it was
‘on the opposite side of the street’ to the brewery.<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> However
this may be, there are other notices which show that, however complete
the demolition of 1644, the theatre or part of it was still regarded
by tradition as standing a hundred years later amongst the tenements
by which it was replaced.<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> In 1787 the brewery was purchased
by Barclay and Perkins, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span> conveyance recites amongst other
property a plot of ground between Globe Alley and a common sewer, from
which had been cleared in 1767 some ‘ruinous and decayed’ tenements
formerly occupied in 1715 by John Knowles and others.<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> This is
probably the clearance referred to by Mrs. Piozzi. Under Acts of 1786
and 1812 Globe Alley was closed, and it is now covered over within the
brewery precinct. Horwood’s map of 1799 shows the eastern end already
obliterated. The western end is called Globe Walk, and to the north of
it is Globe Court, perhaps representing the space cleared in 1767.</p>

<p>On the assumption that the theatre stood in Globe Alley, there has
been divergence of opinion as to the precise part of the Alley in
which it stood. Mr. Rendle fixed on a spot on the north side, about
80 or 100 feet from the Deadman’s Place end.<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> To this he was
guided, partly by a further local tradition, according to which the
site was occupied successively by a meeting-house and a windmill, and
partly by an argument derived from the entries in the St. Saviour’s
token-book for 1621.<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> Here, under the heading ‘Sir John Bodley’s
Rentes’ are recorded in succession about ten names. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span> comes a new
heading, differently written, ‘Gloab Alley’, then two more names, then
in the margin of the page the word ‘Gloabe’. This Mr. Rendle took
to mean that the Globe was about twelve houses from the east end of
the alley. If this is an indication of the site of the Globe at all,
which is a mere conjecture, I should myself draw the inference that it
stood, not twelve, but two houses from the end of the alley, and that
a part, if not the whole, of Bodley’s Rents was outside the alley. And
why should the enumerator be supposed to have worked from the east,
rather than from the north end of the alley? Dr. Martin, in fact,
turns Mr. Rendle’s argument round in this way, and uses the token-book
to support a theory which places the theatre south of Globe Alley,
just at the angle where it turns to the north, and 360 feet, instead
of Mr. Rendle’s 80 or 100 feet, west of Deadman’s Place.<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> Here
it appears to be located in a borough history of 1795;<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> and is
certainly located in more than one early nineteenth-century plan.<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>
Dr. Martin has attempted to obtain confirmation of this siting from an
investigation of the brewery title-deeds. From 1727 onwards the history
of the angle site is clear. In that year it was transferred, subject
to a mortgage, by Timothy Cason and his wife Elizabeth, heiress of the
Brend estate, to certain parishioners of St. Saviour’s. Upon it was
built the parish workhouse referred to by Concanen and Morgan. This
stood just at the outer south-west angle of Globe Alley, which Dr.
Martin conceives to have been occupied by the theatre. In 1774 a new
workhouse was built, and the site of the old one bought by the Thrales.
It was conveyed with the rest of the brewery to Barclay and Perkins
in 1787, and was then described as the ground ‘on which lately stood
all that great shop or workhouse formerly used for a meeting-house’.
Dr. Martin thinks that this forgotten meeting-house may have been
confused in local tradition with that further to the east along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span> Globe
Alley.<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> Dr. Martin suggests that the property transferred by
the Casons in 1727 is to be identified with that described in a deed
executed by the same persons in 1706, of which a copy is also to be
found amongst the brewery title-deeds, as consisting of tenements built
‘where the late play-house called the Globe stood and upon the ground
thereunto belonging’. If this were so, he would of course have proved
his point. The deed of 1706 seems to have been a family settlement
covering various fragments of Brend property in Southwark, which had
only just been brought together in the hands of Elizabeth Cason. The
Globe site had been settled by Sir Matthew Brend in 1624 upon his
wife Frances as a jointure. She died in 1673, and it then passed as
a jointure to Judith, wife of Sir Matthew’s son Thomas and mother of
Elizabeth, under a deed of 1655 in which the reference to ‘the late
play-house called the Globe’, repeated in that of 1706, first occurs.
Judith Brend had died in 1706.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it is almost impossible to reconcile the Southwark
tradition that the Globe stood on the south of Maiden Lane, either
in Mr. Rendle’s or in Dr. Martin’s interpretation of it, with more
than one bit of evidence which we owe to the research of Professor
Wallace. The first of these is the lease of 1599 itself, as recited in
the pleadings of <i>Ostler v. Heminges</i>. This states quite clearly
that the leased plot abutted on a piece of land called the Park ‘super
boream’ and on Maiden Lane ‘versus austrum’, and it is difficult to
take very seriously either the Latinity which makes ‘versus austrum’
mean that the leased plot was on the south, or the suggestion that the
draughtsman was working carelessly from a plan which had the south
instead of the north of the plot at the top of the sheet, and got
the points of his compass wrong.<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> I daresay that such things do
sometimes happen in conveyancer’s offices, but it is hardly legitimate
to call them in aid as a canon of interpretation. No doubt it is
tempting to identify the piece of land called the Park with the Bishop
of Winchester’s park, which lay at a reasonable distance to the south
and not to the north of Maiden Lane, but after all this must once have
extended nearly up to the Bankside, since Maiden Lane itself is known
to have been cut out of it, and it is not at all improbable that some
little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span> strip of land retained the name.<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> It can only have been
a very little one. The lease describes the Globe site as consisting
of two plots lying apparently on opposite sides of a way or alley
(<i>venella</i>) by which access was obtainable to them. One of these,
that next the Park, had been the gardens of Thomas Burt, Isbrand
Morris, and Lactantius Roper. It was 220 feet in length and lay between
the garden of John Knowles on the east and John Cornish on the west.
The southern plot, bounded by Maiden Lane on the south, had similarly
been the gardens of John Roberts and Thomas Ditcher. This was only 156
feet long and 100 feet deep, and lay between the gardens of William
Sellers to the east and John Burgram to the west. Now the whole space
between Maiden Lane and the Thames is only from 200 to 350 feet at
various points, so that there could not have been room for much of a
‘park’ between the Globe site and the Bankside houses.</p>

<p>The evidence of the lease is confirmed in various ways by the records
of presentments made by the Commissioners of Sewers for Kent and Surrey
against negligent occupiers in this marshy neighbourhood. The most
important entry is one of 14 February 1606:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘It is ordered that Burbidge and Heminges and others, the owners
of the Play-house called the Globe in Maid-Lane shall before the
xx<sup>th</sup> day of Aprill next pull vp and take cleane out of the
Sewar the props or postes which stand vnder their bridge on the
north side of Mayd-lane vpon paine to forfeit xx<sup>s</sup>.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">This is endorsed ‘done’, but another order of the same day requiring
the same men to ‘well and sufficientlye pyle boorde and fill vp viij
poles more or lesse of theire wharfe against theire said Play-house’
needed a repetition on 25 April before it received attention.<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a>
Earlier records, before the Globe came into existence, relate to some
of the garden-holders named in the lease. A plot of John Bingham or
Burgram abutted on a Maiden Lane sewer in 1596, and this is probably
identical with the ‘common sewer leading from Sellors gardin to the
beare garden’, which William Sellers and others were ordered to cleanse
on 5 December 1595. Certainly the bear garden was to the north and
not the south of Maiden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span> Lane. There was also a sewer bordering upon
the park, and on this Jasper Morris and Thomas Burt had encroached in
1593.<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a></p>

<p>The old maps, as usual, do not give much help when it comes to a pinch,
although the balance of their authority, for what it is worth, seems to
me to be in favour of a northern site.<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> Mr. Hubbard, calculating
from Visscher’s map, would put the Globe on the site of the present
Central Wharf, 15 feet south of the Bankside houses and 136 feet west
of Bank End, and therefore not very near Maiden Lane at all.<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> I do
not think that he sufficiently recognizes the imperfections of the maps
from a surveyor’s point of view. I doubt whether more is to be got out
of them than that the Globe stood more to the east and probably more to
the south than either the Hope or the Rose.<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing paragraphs show the state of the controversy when the
body of this chapter was written. Since then Mr. Braines has taken
up the investigation where it was left by Dr. Martin, with the help
of the brewery title-deeds and many other documents bearing on the
distribution of tenements in Maiden Lane and Globe Alley over more than
a century. It now seems clear that, in view of the known history of
properties north of Maiden Lane, there is no room for the Globe plot
there, that this plot did pass from the Casons to the workhouse and
ultimately the brewery, and that it did lie at Dr. Martin’s angle site,
being indeed precisely located on the map by Concanen and Morgan’s
description of 1795. We must therefore assume that the points of the
compass were, as Dr. Martin conjectured, inverted in the lease of
1599, east with west and north with south, and that the Globe company
maintained a bridge over the sewer on the opposite side of Maiden Lane
to the theatre, for the convenience of visitors coming down Horseshoe
Alley from the river. The <i>venella</i> of 1599 must have been a
westward extension of Globe Alley, afterwards disused.</p>

<p>Some notion of the structural character of the Globe may be gleaned
from the builder’s contract for the Fortune in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span> 1600.<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> The Globe
was then the last new thing in theatres, and in entering into his
agreement for the Fortune with Peter Street, the builder of both
houses, Henslowe was careful to specify that the Globe should be taken
as the model, alike as regards the arrangement of the galleries and
staircases, the contrivances and fashioning of the stage, and all
other minor points not particularly indicated. The only alterations of
design set out in the agreement were that the scantlings or standard
measurements of the timber should be rather stouter than those of the
Globe, and that the main posts of the stage and auditorium should
be shaped square and carved with figures of satyrs. It is probable,
however, that a more important difference is passed without notice.
The Fortune was rectangular; the Globe was almost certainly round.
The reference to a circular house in <i>Henry V</i> and <i>A Warning
for Fair Women</i>, both plays of about 1599, may indeed belong to
the Curtain rather than the Globe, but there are similar references
in <i>E. M. O.</i> (1599) and in <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i>
(1608), which are certainly Globe plays, and there seems no reason
to doubt that the Globe is represented by the cylindrical buildings,
windowless below, windowed and of narrower diameter above, which
are shown in the maps of the Hondius group and in the background of
Delaram’s portrait of James I.<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> A few details are furnished by the
various narratives of the fire of 1613. The roof was thatched, whence
arose the accident. The walls were of timber, for nothing was burnt
but wood and straw. The building was ‘flanked with a ditch, and forced
out of a marish’. It had a stage-house ‘round as taylors clewe’, and
carried a silken flag. There were two narrow doors, and hard by stood
an alehouse. The new Globe built after the fire was tiled for greater
safety. In other respects there was probably no great change. The
building is described in 1634 as of timber, upon an old foundation.
The maps, if they can be trusted, figure it as polygonal, rather than
strictly round. No doubt it was round inside; an ‘amphytheator’, it is
called in <i>Holland’s Leaguer</i>. The <i>Sharers Papers</i> of 1635
mention the tiring-house door, at which money was taken. James Wright
tells us that it was a summer house, large and partly open to the
weather, and that the acting was always by daylight. Malone conjectured
that the name ‘Globe’ was taken from the sign, ‘which was a figure
of Hercules supporting the Globe, under which was written <i>Totus
mundus agit histrionem</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> I do not know where he got this

<p>The settlement of the Chamberlain’s men in 1599 at the Globe, hard by
the Rose, on Bankside, probably led Henslowe and Alleyn to plan during
the same year a countermove, by the transference of the Admiral’s
men to a new theatrical locality in the rapidly growing districts on
the north-west boundary of the City. The Rose, although not built
fifteen years, was in decay, and the swamps of the Bankside had not,
especially in bad weather, proved attractive to visitors. The new
centre might be expected to serve in summer and winter alike, and,
while in a place ‘remote and exempt’ from the City jurisdiction, would
be convenient for the well-to-do population, which was establishing
itself in the western suburbs, along the main roads of Holborn and the
Strand. The Fortune on the north, and the Blackfriars, opened about
the same time on the south, delimited a region which has remained
almost to our own day the head-quarters of the stage. The actual site
selected lay just outside Cripplegate between Golding or Golden Lane
and Whitecross Street, in the county of Middlesex, the lordship or
liberty of Finsbury, and the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate.
The title-deeds at Dulwich make it possible to trace the history of
the property or part of it back to the reign of Henry VIII, but for
the present purpose it is sufficient to begin with 11 July 1584, the
date of a lease by Daniel Gill, son of William Gill, gardener, to
Patrick Brewe, goldsmith, of five tenements on the east side of Golding
Lane and one on the west side of Whitecross Street at a rent of £12 a
year. This lease Brewe assigned to Alleyn on 22 December 1599, for a
sum of £240. Subsequently, in 1610, Alleyn bought up a reversionary
lease for £100, and also, after troublesome negotiations with the
numerous descendants of Daniel Gill, the freehold of the property for
£340.<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> This purchase, however, and probably also the original
lease, included a good deal more than the actual plot on which the
theatre was built. The deed of sale recites six tenements on the east
of Golden Lane and six on the west of Whitecross Street. It is pretty
clear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span> from the boundaries described, as compared with those in a
temporary assignment by Alleyn of the lease, that the property dealt
with in 1584 and in 1610 was the same, and it is natural to conclude
that Alleyn had himself added to the number of tenements.<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> This
is confirmed by a note of Alleyn’s that, in addition to building the
play-house, he spent £120 ‘for other priuat buildings of myn owne’. One
such building adjoined the south side of the play-house in 1601.<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a>
Alleyn’s note gives the cost of the play-house itself as £520, making
up with the private buildings and the purchase of leasehold, reversion,
and freehold, a total expenditure of £1,320.<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> The contract for
building the framework was taken by Peter Street, carpenter, at £440,
which presumably left Alleyn £80 for the painting and other decorative
work excluded from the contract. The following is the text of the
contract, which is preserved at Dulwich:<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a></p>

Fortune.</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The constant references in the terms of the contract to the model
of the Globe, while bearing testimony to the stimulus which the
building of the Globe had given to theatrical competition, leaves
some uncertainty as to many details of planning, and it is matter
for regret that the ‘plot’ of the stage and staircases furnished to
the builder has not itself been preserved. We learn, however, that
the house was a square one, 80 feet each way by outside and 55 feet
by inside measurement; that the stage was 43 feet wide and projected
into the middle of the yard; that the framework was of wood, on a
foundation of brick and piles, and with an outer coating of plaster;
that the framework and stage were boarded within and strengthened
with iron pikes; that there were three galleries rising to a total
height of 32 feet, and that sections of these were partitioned off and
ceiled as ‘gentlemens rooms’, of which there were four, and ‘two-penny
rooms’; that the tiring-house had glazed windows; that there was a
‘shadowe or cover’ over the stage, and that this, with the galleries
and staircases, were tiled and supplied with lead gutters to carry off
the rain-water. Two divergences from the Globe model are specified:
the timber work is to be stouter, and the principal posts of the frame
work and stage are to be square and carved with satyrs. An ingenious
attempt has been made by Mr. William Archer and Mr. W. H. Godfrey to
reconstruct the plan of the theatre from these and other indications,
with a liberal allowance of conjecture.<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span> It will be observed
that Henslowe, as well as Alleyn, was a party to the contract; but
it is pretty clear from Alleyn’s note already referred to that he
found the money, and although Henslowe did in fact become his partner
in the enterprise, this was under a lease of 4 April 1601, whereby
he took over a moiety of the play-house and its profits for a term
of twenty-four years from the previous 25 March at an annual rent
of £8.<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> This lease did not include Alleyn’s private tenements,
but it did include some enclosed ‘growndes’ on the north and west of
the house, and a passage 30 feet long by 14 feet wide running east
from the south-west angle of the building ‘from one doore of the said
house to an other’. It is, I think, to be inferred from this that the
main approach to the earlier Fortune theatre was from the Golden Lane
side. The contract with Street is dated on 8 January 1600 and provides
for the completion of the work by the following 25 July, and for the
payment of the price in two instalments, one when the framework was
up and the other upon completion. In fact, however, the acquittances
by Street and others, endorsed upon the Dulwich indenture, show that
Henslowe acted as a kind of banker for the transaction, and made
advances from time to time to Street, or to pay workmen or purchase
materials, all of which were debited against the amounts payable
under the contract. Work seems to have begun before 17 January. By
20 March Henslowe had paid £180 and by 4 May £240. It is therefore a
little puzzling to find a payment ‘at the eand of the fowndations’
on 8 May. About £53 more was paid before 10 June, making nearly £300
in all by that date. The last entry is one of 4s. to Street ‘to
pasify him’, which suggests that some dispute had taken place. Here
the acquittances stop, but Henslowe’s <i>Diary</i> indicates that he
was frequently dining in company with Street from 13 June to August
8, and probably the work was completed about the latter date.<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a>
Alleyn had had to face some opposition in carrying out his project.
He began by arming himself with the authority of his ‘lord’, the Earl
of Nottingham, who wrote in his favour to the Middlesex justices on
12 January 1600, explaining the reasons for leaving the Bankside and
the general convenience of the new locality, and citing the Queen’s
‘special regarde of fauor’ towards the company as a reason why the
justices should allow his servant to build ‘w<sup>th</sup>out anie yo<sup>r</sup> lett
or molestation’. This action did not prove sufficient to avert a local
protest. Lord Willoughby and others complained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span> to the Council, who
on 9 March wrote to the Middlesex justices informing them that the
erection of a new play-house, ‘wherof ther are to manie allreadie
not farr from that place’, would greatly displease the Queen, and
commanding the project to be ‘staied’. Alleyn, however, was secure
in the royal favour. He also, by offering a weekly contribution to
the relief of the poor, succeeded in obtaining a certificate from the
petty officials and other inhabitants of Finsbury of their consent to
the toleration of the house; and on 8 April the Council wrote again to
the justices, withdrawing their previous inhibition and laying special
stress on Elizabeth’s desire that Alleyn personally should revive his
services as a player, ‘wheareof, of late he hath made discontynuance’.
The letter also referred to the fact that another house was pulled
down instead of the Fortune, and a formal Privy Council order of 22
June, laying down that there shall in future be one house in Middlesex
for the Admiral’s men, and one on the Bankside for the Chamberlain’s,
makes it clear that the condemned theatre was the Curtain.<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a>
Nevertheless, it is certain that neither the Curtain nor the Rose was
in fact plucked down at this date.</p>

<p>The Fortune was opened in the autumn of 1600 by the Admiral’s men,
probably with Dekker’s <i>1 Fortune’s Tennis</i>, and its theatrical
history is closely bound up with that of the same company, who occupied
it continuously, as the Admiral’s to 1603, then as Prince Henry’s
men to his death in 1612, and finally as the Palsgrave’s men. It is
only necessary to deal here with matters that directly concern the
building. That it became something of a centre of disturbance in the
peaceful suburbs of the north-west is shown by various entries in the
records of the Middlesex Bench. On 26 February 1611, two butchers,
Ralph Brewyn and John Lynsey, were charged with abusing gentlemen
there. On 1 October 1612, the justices regarded it as the resort of
cutpurses, and were thereby led to suppress the jigs at the end of
plays, which especially attracted such persons. In 1613 a true bill
was found against Richard Bradley for stabbing Nicholas Bedney there
on 5 June.<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> The upkeep of the structure was expensive. A note
in Alleyn’s hand of sums laid out upon the play-house during the
seven years 1602–8 shows an average amount of about £120. Only £4
2<i>s.</i> was spent during 1603, for the greater part of which year
the theatres were closed, but £232 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in 1604.<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a>
No doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span> wooden buildings, open to the weather, perished rapidly. It
is not unreasonable to suppose that the relations between the company
and their landlords were much what they had been at the Rose; that
is to say that the latter took half the gallery receipts and bore
repairs, while the former took the rest of the receipts and met all
other outgoings. An unexecuted draft lease to Thomas Downton of 1608
indicates that Alleyn and Henslowe then had it in mind to bind the
company more closely to the theatre, by dividing a quarter of their
interest amongst the eight members of the company.<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> Possibly the
plan was carried out. In asking a loan from Alleyn on a date apparently
earlier than August 1613, Charles Massye, who was one of the eight, not
only offers repayment out of his ‘gallery mony’ and ‘house mony’, but
also the assignment of ‘that lyttell moete I have in the play housses’
as a security.<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> Certainly the company took over the house after
Henslowe’s death on 6 January 1616. His share in the building passed
to his widow, who contemplated a sale of it to Gregory Franklyn, Drew
Stapley, and John Hamond.<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> But the deed remained unexecuted at her
death in 1617, and the whole property was now once more in Alleyn’s
hands. On 31 October 1618 he leased it to the company for £200 a year,
to be reduced to £120 at his death. With it went a taphouse occupied by
Mark Brigham, the rent of a two-room tenement held by John Russell, and
a strip of impaled ground 123 feet by 17 feet, lying next the passage
on the south.<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> This is perhaps the garden in which, according to
John Chamberlain, the players, ‘not to be overcome with courtesy’,
banqueted the Spanish ambassador when he visited the theatre on 16 July
1621.<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> John Russell is presumably the same whose appointment by
Alleyn as a ‘gatherer’ lead to a protest from William Bird on behalf
of the company.<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> A few months after the ambassador’s visit, John
Chamberlain records the destruction of the Fortune on 9 December
1621:<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘On Sonday night here was a great fire at the Fortune in
Golden-Lane, the fayrest play-house in this towne. It was quite
burnt downe in two howres, &amp; all their apparell &amp; play-bookes
lost, wherby those poore companions are quite undone.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Alleyn also notes the event in his diary.<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> On 20 May
1622 he formed a syndicate, and leased to it the site at a rent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>
£128 6<i>s.</i>, under an obligation to build a new theatre at a cost
of £1,000.<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> This, ‘a large round brick building’, was erected in
the following year.<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> The site conveyed covered a space of almost
exactly 130 feet square, and on it had stood, besides the buildings
named in the lease of 1618, other tenements, in one of which William
Bird himself lived. Mr. Lawrence has suggested that the new Fortune may
have been a roofed-in house, but his evidence is hardly sufficient to
outweigh the explicit statement of Wright that it ‘lay partly open to
the weather, and there they always acted by daylight’.<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> This can
hardly refer only to the earlier building. The Fortune was dismantled
in 1649 and ‘totally demolished’ by 1662, and the façade still extant
in 1819 cannot therefore have belonged to it, although it may have
belonged to a Restoration ‘nursery’ for young actors, possibly upon the
same site.<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> No acting seems to have taken place at the Fortune
after 1649.<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a></p>


<h5>xiii. THE BOAR’S HEAD</h5>

<p>There appear to have been at least six city inns under this sign.<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>
The most famous was that on the south side of Great Eastcheap, in
St. Michael’s, which seems to have been regarded in the middle of
the sixteenth century as the traditional locality of the tavern
scenes in <i>Henry IV</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> This inn was in the occupation of
Joan Broke, widow, in 1537, and in that of Thomas Wright, vintner,
about 1588.<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> Another Boar’s Head stood ‘without’ Aldgate, in the
extra-mural Portsoken ward, which lay between that gate and the bars
with which the liberties of the City terminated at Hog Lane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span> Here,
according to Stowe, there were ‘certaine faire Innes for receipt of
trauellers repayring to the Citie’.<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> At the Aldgate inn had been
produced in 1557 a ‘lewd’ play called <i>The Sackful of Newes</i>,
which provoked the interference of Mary’s Privy Council.<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> But it
seems to me exceedingly improbable that either this or the Eastcheap
inn was converted into the play-house, of which we have brief and
tantalizing records in the seventeenth century. Both were within the
City jurisdiction, where the licensing of play-houses seems to have
definitely terminated in 1596. It is true that a Privy Council letter
of 31 March 1602, which directs that the combined company of Oxford’s
and Worcester’s men shall be allowed to play at the Boar’s Head, is
addressed to the Lord Mayor.<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> But so are other letters of the
same type, the object of which is to limit plays to a small number of
houses outside the liberties, and to restrain them elsewhere over the
whole area of the City and the suburbs.<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> And when, a year or two
later, Worcester’s men became Queen Anne’s, and a draft patent was
drawn up to confirm their right to play in the Curtain and the Boar’s
Head, both houses are described, not as in the City, but as ‘within
our County of Middlesex’.<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> Presumably Anne’s men left the Boar’s
Head when the Red Bull became available for their use in 1606, and Mr.
Adams has explained a mention, which had long puzzled me, of the Duke
of York’s men as ‘the Prince’s Players of Whitechapel’ in 1608 by the
suggestion that they succeeded to the vacant theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> If this is
so, I think it affords further evidence for the theory that the Boar’s
Head, although it may have taken its name from the Aldgate inn, was
not itself that inn, and probably not a converted inn at all, but lay
just outside and not just inside the City bars. For, although part of
the street between Aldgate and Whitechapel is sometimes called, as in
Ogilby’s map of 1677 and Rocque’s of 1746, ‘Whitechapel Street’, yet
Whitechapel proper lay outside the liberties, farther to the east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>
along the Mile End Road.<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> The only other contemporary record of
the Boar’s Head is a letter to Edward Alleyn from his wife Joan on 21
October 1603, in which she says, ‘All the companyes be come hoame &amp;
well for ought we knowe, but that Browne of the Boares head is dead
&amp; dyed very pore, he went not into the countrye at all’.<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> This
Browne cannot be identified, and it is perhaps idle to conjecture
that he may have been related to Robert Browne, and that it may have
been at the Boar’s Head that the latter played with Derby’s men in
1599–1601. The Boar’s Head seems to have been generally forgotten by
the Restoration, but is recalled by the Marquis of Newcastle <i>c.</i>
1660.<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a></p>


<h5>xiv. THE RED BULL</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The records of the suit of
<i>Woodford v. Holland</i> (1613) were printed by J. Greenstreet
in the <i>Athenaeum</i> for 28 Nov. 1885 from <i>Court of
Requests Books</i>, xxvi, ff. 780, 890, and cxxviii, and
therefrom by Fleay, 194; and more fully with those of the later
suit of 1619 (misdated 1620) by C. W. Wallace in <i>Nebraska
University Studies</i>, ix. 291 (cited as <i>W. v. H.</i>).
Collier, i. 374, mentions evidence on the same transactions
as ‘in the Audit Office’, and misnames the complainant John
Woodward.]</p>
</div>

<p>Our chief knowledge of the early history of the Red Bull is derived
from disputes before the Court of Requests in 1613 and 1619 between
Thomas Woodford and Aaron Holland. It appears that Holland held a
lease of the site, which was at the upper end of St. John Street in
the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, from Anne, widow and executrix
of Christopher Bedingfield, and had there built a play-house. The
indication of a Red Bull Yard in Ogilby and Morgan’s map of 1677 to
the west of St. John Street, and just north of the angle which it
forms with Clerkenwell Green, no doubt defines the locality with some
precision.<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> In <i>3 Jac. I</i>, that is, at some date between 24
March 1605 and 23 March 1606, he assigned one-seventh of the house to
Thomas Swynnerton, ‘with a gatherers place thereto belonging’. This
Swynnerton transferred for £50 to Philip Stone.<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> It was subject
to a rent of £2 10<i>s.</i>, and Holland gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span> Stone an indenture in
February 1609, which was alleged not to constitute a proper lease. In
1612–13 Stone sold his seventh for £50 to Woodford, who took profits
for a quarter, and then entrusted his interest to Holland, instructing
his servant Anthony Payne to pay the rent. He alleged that Holland
persuaded Payne to be behindhand with the rent, and withheld the
profits, estimated at £30 a year. He therefore brought his action a
little before May 1613. The Court called upon Holland to show cause why
he should not account for the arrears of profits, and for 1<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> a week due to the gatherer’s place.<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> Holland replied,
and the issues were referred to the arbitration of counsel, including
Woodford’s ‘demaund of the eighteenth penny and the eighteenth part of
such moneys &amp; other comodities as should be collected or receaued ...
for the profittes of the galleries or other places in or belonging to
the play howse’.<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> Counsel made an arrangement, but did not agree
in their reports of its terms, and the Court ordered Holland to give
Woodford an indenture similar to that given to Stone.<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> Holland
got a writ of prohibition from the King’s Bench, always jealous of
the jurisdiction of the Court of Requests, on 6 November 1613, and
Woodford began a suit against Holland in Stone’s name for not making a
proper indenture in 1609. This, he says, Stone conspired with Holland
to withdraw. In 1619 he brought another action for his profits before
the Court of Requests, in which Holland describes him as ‘Woodford,
<i>alias</i> Simball’, but the result is unknown.</p>

<p>The Red Bull, then, was built not later and probably not much earlier
than 1606, a little before the first recorded mention of it in the
following passage from <i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>, which
was almost certainly produced in the winter of 1607:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>‘Citizen.</i> Why so sir, go and fetch me him then, and let
the Sophy of Persia come and christen him a childe.</p>

<p><i>‘Boy.</i> Beleeue me sir, that will not doe so well, ’tis
stale, it has beene had before at the red Bull.’<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The allusion is to an incident in the last scene of Day, Rowley, and
Wilkins’ <i>Travels of the Three Brothers</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> This, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>
to the entry in the Stationers’ Register on 29 June 1607, was played
at the Curtain, and according to its title-page of 1607 by the Queen’s
men. But there is no reason why it should not also have been played
at the Red Bull, since both houses are specified as occupied by the
Queen’s men in their patent of 15 April 1609. In their earlier draft
patent of about 1603–4, the Boar’s Head and Curtain are named, and in
a Privy Council letter of 9 April 1604 the Curtain only. Presumably,
therefore, the Red Bull was taken into use by the Queen’s men, of whom
Swynnerton was one, as soon as it was built at some date between 1604
and 1606. The Red Bull is one of the three houses whose contention
is predicted in Dekker’s <i>Raven’s Almanack</i> of 1608, and Dekker
refers to it again in his <i>Work for Armourers</i>, written during the
plague of 1609, when the bear garden was open and the theatres closed.
He says, ‘The pide <i>Bul</i> heere keepes a tossing and a roaring,
when the <i>Red Bull</i> dares not stir’.<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> Its existence caused
trouble from time to time to the Middlesex justices. At the end of May
1610, William Tedcastle, yeoman, and John Fryne, Edward Brian, Edward
Purfett, and Thomas Williams, felt-makers, were called upon to give
recognisances to answer for a ‘notable outrage at the play-house called
the Red Bull’; and on 3 March 1614 Alexander Fulsis was bailed out on
a charge of picking Robert Sweet’s pocket of a purse and £3 at this
theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> Further references to it are to be found in Wither’s
<i>Abuses Stript and Whipt</i> (1613), in Tomkis’s <i>Albumazar</i>
(1615), and in Gayton’s <i>Pleasant Notes on Don Quixot</i>
(1654).<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a></p>

<p>An entry in Alleyn’s <i>Diary</i> for 1617 has been supposed to
indicate that he had an interest in the Red Bull. To me it only
suggests that he sold the actors there a play.<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span></p>

<p>The Queen’s men most likely occupied the Red Bull at least until
1617 when, as shown by the lawsuit of 1623, they were on the point
of moving to the Cockpit in Drury Lane. Plays of theirs were printed
as acted there in 1608, 1611, 1612, and 1615. <i>Swetnam the Woman
Hater Arraigned by Women</i>, printed in 1620, was also played there,
before Anne’s death in 1619. In 1637 Thomas Heywood, formerly one of
the Queen’s men, included in his <i>Pleasant Dialogues and Dramas</i>,
a Prologue and Epilogue, to which he prefixed the note ‘A young witty
lad playing the part of Richard the third: at the Red Bull: the Author
because hee was interessed in the play to incourage him, wrot him this
Prologue and Epilogue’.<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> This was probably, and certainly if the
play was Shakespeare’s, some quite exceptional performance. Similarly
the ‘companie of young men of this citie’, who are stated on the
title-page of Wentworth Smith’s <i>Hector of Germany</i> (1615) to have
acted it at the Red Bull and Curtain, must be supposed to have used
these theatres by some arrangement with the Queen’s men.</p>

<p>The Red Bull afterwards passed to other companies, continued in use up
to, and even occasionally during, the Commonwealth, and had a revived
life after the Restoration to 1663.<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> Before 1633, and probably
before 1625, it had been re-edified and enlarged.<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> Mr. Lawrence
suggests that at this time it became a roofed house, which it seems
certainly to have been after the Restoration.<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> But it is difficult
to get away from Wright’s explicit statement that it ‘lay partly open
to the weather, and there they always acted by daylight’.<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> Nor
need the quite modern identification of it with the roofed interior
depicted in <i>The Wits</i> rest upon anything but an incidental
reference to the house in the text of the pamphlet.<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> Nothing is
known as to the shape or galleries of the Red Bull.</p>


<h5>xv. THE HOPE</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The Dulwich papers relating to
the connexion of Henslowe and Alleyn with the bear-baiting
and the Hope are to be found with a commentary in Greg,
<i>Henslowe’s Diary</i> and <i>Henslowe Papers</i>. Valuable

Furnivall, <i>Harrison’s Description of England</i>, Part II,

(1901) in <i>Surrey Arch. Colls.</i> xvi. 55. Since I wrote this
chapter, C. L. Kingsford (1920, <i>Arch.</i> lxx. 155) has added
valuable material.]</p>
</div>

<p>It is convenient, in connexion with the Hope, to deal with the
whole rather troublesome question of the Bankside Bear Gardens.
The <i>ursarius</i> or bearward was a recognized type of mediaeval
<i>mimus</i>, and the rewards in which his welcome found expression
are a recurring item in many a series of municipal or domestic
accounts. Thus, to take one example only, the corporation of
Shrewsbury entertained between 1483 and 1542 the <i>ursinarii</i>,
<i>ursuarii</i>, or <i>ursiatores</i> of the King, the Dukes of
Norfolk and Suffolk, the Marquises of Dorset and Exeter, the Earl
of Derby, and the town of Norwich.<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> On more than one occasion
the payment is said to be <i>pro agitacione bestiarum suarum</i>.
The phrase is perhaps not free from ambiguity. The dancing bear was,
until quite recently, a familiar sight in provincial England, and I
have seen one even on the sophisticated slopes of Notting Hill. And
illuminations dating back as far as the tenth century bear evidence to
the antiquity of his somewhat grotesque <i>tripudium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> But in
the robust days of our forefathers there was an even more attractive
way of agitating bears. The traditional victim of an English baiting
was no doubt the bull. A Southwark map of 1542 shows a ‘Bolrynge’ in
the middle of the High Street and a neighbouring alley still bore
the name in 1561.<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> The maps of Höfnagel (<i>c.</i> 1560) and
Agas (<i>c.</i> 1570) show another ring, marked ‘The bolle bayting’
and with a very palpable bull inside it, upon the Bankside, not far
from where the Hope must afterwards have stood.<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a> But the bear
was also baited in London, at least from the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a>
Erasmus is often cited as declaring that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span> in the reign of Henry VIII
‘herds’ of the animal were kept for the purpose. This is an error.
Erasmus wrote of dancing bears; but I am afraid it must be assumed
that the chief function of the bearward attached to the Tudor Royal
Household was to provide exhibitions of the more brutal, noisy, and
occasionally dangerous sport.<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> A regular office is traceable back
to 1484, when Richard III in the first year of his reign appointed
his bearward John Browne to be ‘Maister, Guyder and Ruler of all our
Beres and Apes’.<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> It was still a part of the establishment of
the Royal Household under Elizabeth. A patent of 2 June 1573 to Ralph
Bowes describes it as ‘the room or office of Cheif Master Overseer and
Ruler of all and singular our game pastymes and sportes, that is to
saie of all and everie our beares bulles and mastyve dogges’, and names
as Bowes’s predecessors Cuthbert Vaughan and Sir Richard Long.<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a>
The grant was of the nature of a commission, authorizing the holder,
personally or by deputy, to ‘take up’ or press animals for the royal
service, and giving him the sole right of baiting the Queen’s bears,
to the exclusion of any other officer or under officer appertaining
to the bears, not specially licensed or appointed by him. The Master
was presumably expected to make his profit out of the privileges
granted, for the patent did not assign him any fee, such as the under
officers, known as the Keepers of Bears and Mastiffs, enjoyed at the
hands of the Treasurer of the Chamber.<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> But he received a reward,
similar to those given to players, of £5 through the Treasurer on the
Council’s warrant, when the baiting was shown before the Queen. These
rewards are generally expressed as ‘for the Game of Paris Garden’
or ‘to the Master of her Majesty’s Game at Paris Garden’; and Bowes
must have joined sons or other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span> relatives with him as deputies, since
Edward Bowes and Thomas Bowes were often payees instead of Ralph Bowes
during his term of office.<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> Towards the end of Bowes’s life it
would seem that Henslowe and Alleyn, who had been baiting bears on
the Bankside as licensees since 1594, were in negotiation to obtain
the Mastership.<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> Probably the first idea was to buy a surrender
of the office from Bowes, since the Dulwich manuscripts contain an
unexecuted draft of a patent to Henslowe, following the terms of
that to Bowes himself and reciting such a surrender.<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> I should
suppose this negotiation to be that in connexion with which Henslowe
spent £2 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> during 1597 upon visits to Sir Julius
Caesar, Master of Requests, and other Court officials, and in a fee
to the Clerk of the Signet. The expenditure is entered in the diary
as incurred ‘a bowt the changinge of ower comysion’.<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> But before
a surrender was effected it would seem that Henslowe had had to turn
his thoughts to a succession. In this he was disappointed. On 4 June
1598 he wrote to Alleyn that Bowes was very sick and expected to die,
and that he much feared he should lose all. Neither Caesar nor the
Lord Admiral had done anything for him, and although he had received
help from Lady Edmondes and Mr. Langworth, he now learnt that the
reversion of the Mastership was already promised by the Queen to one
Mr. Dorrington, a pensioner.<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> Bowes did in effect die very shortly
after, and on 11 August 1598 John Dorrington received his patent for
the Mastership.<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> To this was joined the office of Keeper of the
Bandogs and Mastiffs, with a fee of 10<i>d.</i> a day for exercising
this office and keeping twenty mastiff bitches, and a further fee of
4<i>d.</i> for a deputy.<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> It is not unlikely that John Dorrington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>
was related to the Richard Darrington who had held this keepership with
the same fees, amounting to £21 5<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> a year, in 1571.
Another keepership, that of the Bears, was held in 1599 by Jacob Meade,
who was closely associated with Henslowe and Alleyn in the management
of the Bear garden.<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> Dorrington’s grant was confirmed by James
I on 14 July 1603, and on 23 July he was knighted.<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> About this
time Henslowe and Alleyn, who were paying Dorrington £40 a year for
licence to bait,<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> must have contemplated fresh negotiations for
a transfer of the patent, for the draft in the Dulwich manuscripts,
originally drawn up about 1597, has been altered by Henslowe so as
to adapt it to the new reign and to a surrender by Dorrington.<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a>
But once again they were unsuccessful, for Dorrington died, and on 20
July 1604 the Mastership was granted to one of the invading Scots,
Sir William Stuart.<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> From him, however, Henslowe and Alleyn
did succeed in obtaining an assignment, and a draft patent as joint
Masters and Keepers, with the fees of 10<i>d.</i> and 4<i>d.</i>, is
dated 24 November 1604. They had, indeed, been rather in Stuart’s
hands, for he had refused either to give them a licence or to take
over their house and bears, and they had to pay for the surrender at
what they considered the high rate of £450.<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> This we learn from
a petition of about 1607, in which they appealed to the King for an
increase in the daily fee by 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, in view of their
losses through restraints and the deaths of bears, and of their heavy
expenses, amounting to £200 a month, whereby their privilege, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>
was once worth £100 a year, could now not be let at all.<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> It is
doubtful whether they got any relief. They had a new patent on 24
November 1608;<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> but about 1612 they sent up another petition in
very similar terms. A grant of £42 10<i>s.</i> and 12<i>d.</i> a day
had, indeed, been made them in March 1611 for keeping a lion and two
white bears. But this was probably menagerie work and quite apart from
the baiting. They continued as joint Masters until Henslowe’s death in
1616, when the whole office passed to Alleyn in survivorship.<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a></p>

<p>When baiting seemed desirable to the soul of the sovereign, the ‘game’
was generally brought to the Court, wherever the Court might happen to
be.<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> The rewards of the Treasurer of the Chamber were most often
for attendances in the Christmas holidays or at Whitsuntide. But the
game might be called for at any time to add lustre to the entertainment
of an ambassador or other distinguished visitor to Court. Thus on 25
May 1559 French ambassadors dined with Elizabeth, ‘and after dener to
bear and bull baytyng, and the Quens grace and the embassadurs stod in
the galere lokyng of the pastym tyll vj at nyght’.<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> Later French
embassies of 1561, 1572, 1581, and 1599, and a Danish embassy of 1586
were similarly honoured.<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> The custom continued during the next
reign. On 19 August 1604 there was a grand banquet at Whitehall for
Juan Fernandez de Velasco, Constable of Castile, on the completion of
peace between England and Spain, and thereafter a ball, and after the
ball ‘all then took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span> their places at the windows of the room which
looked out upon a square, where a platform was raised, and a vast
crowd had assembled to see the King’s bears fight with greyhounds.
This afforded great amusement. Presently a bull, tied to the end of a
rope, was fiercely baited by dogs.’<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> James had introduced a new
and dangerous element into the sport by using the lions which were
kept in the Tower, and this also became the scene of baitings. On 5
March 1607 the Treasurer of the Chamber paid Henslowe and Alleyn no
less than £30, partly for attendances with the game at Greenwich during
the visit of the King of Denmark and at Whitehall during that of the
Prince de Joinville, and partly for baiting of the lions in the Tower
on three several occasions.<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> Stowe gives detailed descriptions
of lion-baitings in 1604, 1605, 1609, and 1610, of which the first
is interesting, because it was under the personal superintendence of
Edward Alleyn, ‘now sworne the Princes man and Maister of the Beare
Garden’.<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a></p>

<p>But the profit of the thing, from the point of view of the Master of
the Game, was not so much in the attendances at Court, as in the public
baitings, which he and those holding licences from him were privileged
to give with the bears and dogs, ‘taken up’ by virtue of the commission
or bought at their own expense, during such times as these were not
required for the royal service. These public spectacles were held at
what was known as the Bear Garden, under conditions much resembling
those of a theatre. They played a considerable part in the life of
London; literature is full of allusions to them; and they are described
with more or less detail in the narratives of many travellers from
abroad. An early account is that from the Spanish of a secretary to
the Duke of Najera, who visited Henry VIII in 1544.<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> He describes
the bears as baited daily, with three or four dogs to each bear, in an
enclosure where they were tied with ropes, and adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Into the same place they brought a pony with an ape fastened on
its back, and to see the animal kicking amongst the dogs, with
the screams of the ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears
and neck of the pony, is very laughable.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">In 1559 the same French ambassadors, who saw the baiting
at Whitehall, were taken on the following day to Paris Garden, and
‘ther was boyth bare and bull baytyng, and the capten with a c. of the
gard to kepe rowme for them to see the baytyng’.<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> The next notice
of any value is that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span> Lupold von Wedel, who was at Southwark on 23
August 1584.<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘There is a round building three stories high, in which are
kept about a hundred large English dogs, with separate wooden
kennels for each of them. These dogs were made to fight singly
with three bears, the second bear being larger than the first
and the third larger than the second. After this a horse was
brought in and chased by the dogs, and at last a bull, who
defended himself bravely. The next was that a number of men
and women came forward from a separate compartment, dancing,
conversing and fighting with each other: also a man who threw
some white bread among the crowd, that scrambled for it. Right
over the middle of the place a rose was fixed, this rose being
set on fire by a rocket: suddenly lots of apples and pears fell
out of it down upon the people standing below. Whilst the people
were scrambling for the apples, some rockets were made to fall
down upon them out of the rose, which caused a great fright but
amused the spectators. After this, rockets and other fireworks
came flying out of all corners, and that was the end of the
play.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">It is interesting to observe that the baiting proper
was supplemented with fireworks and an entertainment, which must have
been of the nature of a jig.<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> The visit of Frederick, Duke of
Württemberg, on 1 September 1592, is also recorded by his secretary,
who says:<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘His Highness was shown in London the English dogs, of which
there were about 120, all kept in the same enclosure, but each
in a separate kennel. In order to gratify his Highness, and at
his desire, two bears and a bull were baited; at such times you
can perceive the breed and mettle of the dogs, for although they
receive serious injuries from the bears, are caught by the horns
of the bull, and tossed into the air so as frequently to fall
down again upon the horns, they do not give in, so that one is
obliged to pull them back by their tails, and force open their
jaws. Four dogs at once were set on the bull; they, however,
could not gain any advantage over him, for he so artfully
contrived to ward off their attacks that they could not well get
at him; on the contrary, the bull served them very scurvily by
striking and butting at them.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[456]</span></p>

<p class="p-left">De Witt briefly notices the ‘amphitheatrum’ of the Bear Garden in 1596.
He says:<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Est etiam quintum sed dispari [vsu?] et structura, bestiarum
concertationi destinatum, in quo multi vrsi, tauri, et stupendae
magnitudinis canes discretis caueis et septis aluntur, qui
ad pugnam adseruantur, iocundissimum hominibus spectaculum
praebentes.’</p>
</div>

<p>Hentzner, who visited London in the autumn of 1598, says:<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Est et alius postea locus Theatri quoque formam habens,
Ursorum &amp; Taurorum venationibus destinatus, qui à postica parte
alligati à magnis illis canibus &amp; molossis Anglicis, quos lingua
vernacula Docken appellant, mire exagitantur, ita tamen, ut
saepe canes isti ab Ursis vel Tauris, dentibus arrepti, vel
cornibus impetiti, de vita periclitari, aliquando etiam animam
exhalare soleant, quibus sic vel sauciis vel lassis statim

tamen se defendit, circumstantes, &amp; nimium appropinquantes, nisi
recte &amp; provide sibi caveant, prosternit, ac flagella e manibus
cadentium eripit atque confringit.’</p>
</div>

<p>To 1599 belongs the account of Thomas Platter of Basle:<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The London bearbaitings usually take place every Sunday and
Wednesday, across the water. The play house is built in circular
form; above are a number of seated galleries; the ground space
under the open sky is unoccupied. In the midst of this a great
bear is fastened to a stake by a long rope. When we came down
the stairs, we went behind the play house, and saw the English
dogs, of which there were about 120 chained up, each in his
separate kennel, in a yard.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Platter also describes the actual baiting of the bull
and bear and of the blind bear, much as did his predecessors. On 7
September 1601 the Duc de Biron was taken to the Bear Garden, as
one of the sights of London, by no less a cicerone than Sir Walter
Raleigh.<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> A visit of 16 September 1602 is described in the diary
of Philip Julius, Duke of Stettin in Pomerania.<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> The vogue of the
Bear Garden amongst foreigners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span> evidently lasted into James’s reign,
but the notices are briefer. Lewis Frederick of Württemberg, saw on 26
April 1610 the baiting both of bears and bulls ‘and monkeys that ride
on horseback’;<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> and Justus Zingerling of Thuringia, who was in
London about the same year, mentions the ‘<i>theatra comoedorum</i>,
in which bears and bulls fight with dogs’.<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> Even more summary
is the reference in an itinerary of Prince Otto von Hesse-Cassel in
1611.<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> But the extracts given sufficiently describe the nature
of the sport, and show that bulls continued to be baited up to a
late date, as well as bears, and that the serious business of the
spectacle was diversified by regular humorous episodes, such as the
monkey on horseback and the whipping of the blind bear. He, by the
way, was called Harry Hunks, and is named by Sir John Davies in his
<i>Epigrams</i><a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> of <i>c.</i> 1594, in company with the Sackerson
who gave rise to a boast on the part of Master Slender,<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> and at a
later date by Dekker<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> and Henry Peacham.<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> Two other famous
bears were Ned Whiting and George Stone. Both are alluded to in Ben
Jonson’s <i>Epicoene</i> (1609),<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a> and the latter also in <i>The
Puritan</i> (1607).<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> The death of the ‘goodlye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span> beare’ George
Stone at a baiting before the King of Denmark in 1606 is lamented in
the petition of Henslowe and Alleyn to the King for increased fees
already described. One other interesting notice of the sport may be
added from the Dulwich collection, and that is an advertisement or
‘bill’ of the entertainment, which runs as follows:</p>



<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Tomorrowe beinge Thursdaie shalbe seen at the Beargardin on the
banckside a greate mach plaid by the gamstirs of Essex who hath
chalenged all comers what soeuer to plaie v dogges at the single
beare for v pounds and also to wearie a bull dead at the stake
and for your better content shall haue plasant sport with the
horse and ape and whiping of the blind beare. Viuat Rex.’<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Where then was the Bear Garden? This is a point upon which the foreign
visitors are not very explicit. From them we could infer little more
than that it was transpontine. It has already been pointed out that
in official documents, at any rate those of a less formal character
than a patent under the great seal, the Mastership is described
as the Mastership of the Game of, or at, Paris Garden. With this
common parlance agrees.<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> In the allusions of the pamphleteers
and poets, from the middle of the sixteenth to the middle of the
seventeenth century, Paris or Parish Garden is regularly the place of
baiting.<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> ‘The Beare-garden, commonly called Paris Garden’, says
Stowe, speaking of 1583.<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> At Paris Garden, or as it is sometimes
corruptly spelt, ‘Pallas Garden’, Henslowe and Alleyn have their office
as Masters<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> in 1607, and near it Alleyn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span> is living in 1609. Now
the Liberty and Manor of Paris Garden is a quite well defined part of
the Bankside. It lay at the extreme west end, bordering upon Lambeth
Marsh, with the Clink upon its east. In it stood from about 1595 the
most westerly of the theatres, the Swan.<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> Historians of Southwark
are fond of suggesting that it had been the abode of the bears from
an almost immemorial antiquity, and follow a late edition of Blount’s
seventeenth-century <i>Glossographia</i> in connecting it with the
<i>domus</i> of a certain Robert de Parys, near which the butchers
of London were ordered to throw their garbage in 1393.<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> I think
the idea is that the garbage was found useful for feeding the bears.
This theory I believe to be as much a myth as Taylor the water-poet’s
derivation of the name from Paris, son of Priam. Parish, rather than
Paris Garden, seems, in fact, to be the earlier form, although there
is nothing in the history of the place that very particularly explains
it.<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> Many residents in London were of course ‘de Parys’ in the
fourteenth century, and the <i>domus</i> of the Robert in question, who
lived some time after the first mention of ‘Parish’ Garden, was pretty
clearly on the City and not the Surrey side of the river.<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> It is,
however, the case that before the Civil War the Butchers’ Company had
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span> accustomed to send their offal by a beadle to ‘two barrow houses,
conveniently placed on the river side, for the provision and feeding
of the King’s Game of Bears’, and were directed to resume the practice
after the Restoration; and possibly this is what misled Blount.<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a>
Obviously, however, what the butchers did in the seventeenth century
is no proof of what they did in the fourteenth. And, in fact, the
ordinance of 1393 is explicit in its direction that the offal is
ultimately to be, not devoured by bears, but cast into mid-stream.</p>

<p>There is in fact nothing, so far as I know, to locate the royal Game on
the Bankside at all until the middle of the sixteenth century, when it
was already hard by the stews in the Liberty of the Clink, and still
less, except the persistence of the name, to locate it definitely in
the Liberty of Paris Garden.<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> The notice which brings Paris Garden
nearest is in Foxe’s <i>Book of Martyrs</i>, which contains an account
of an adventure of one Ralph Morice, secretary to Cranmer, who was
foolish enough to take a book of his master’s, containing criticisms
of the Six Articles, in a wherry from Westminster Bridge to Paul’s
Wharf. It chanced that Henry VIII ‘was then in his barge with a great
number of barges and boats about him, then baiting of bears in the
water, over against the Bank’. The waterman stopped to see the fun, and
the bear broke loose, and climbed into the wherry, which upset. The
dangerous book fell into the Thames and was picked up by the bearward,
who was the Lady Elizabeth’s bearward and ‘an arrant Papist’. It was
only through the good offices of Cromwell that Morice escaped serious
trouble. This was about July 1539.<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> Certainly it was the custom
from an early date to moor the King’s barge off Paris Garden.<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span>
The spot was marked later by the Old Barge Stairs, which stood at
the west end of that part of the Bank lying in front of the Garden,
just as Paris Garden Stairs stood at its east end. But the barge was
not necessarily at its moorings when Henry was baiting from it. Mr.
Ordish suggests that it was the common use of Paris Garden Stairs by
visitors to the baiting, which led to the name being transferred to
the Bear Garden itself, without any one troubling to inquire very
minutely whether it stood a little to the east or a little to the west
of the landing.<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> On the whole, however, I regard it as reasonably
probable that there was at one time a Bear Garden in the Liberty,
which fixed the traditional name for the sport, even after it had been
transferred farther along the Bank.<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> It may, perhaps, be a slight
confirmation of this view that the 1627 survey of Paris Garden shows a
space, apparently laid out as a garden and arranged as a circle within
a square, which may represent the site. It stands nearly opposite Paris
Garden Stairs in a triangular bit of ground between Holland Street
and the lane leading to Copt Hall. This seems to have been rather a
desolate region in Elizabeth’s reign, at any rate when you got beyond
the row of houses which lined the bank.<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> If there was a Bear
Garden there, it had clearly been abandoned some little time before
1546, as the Stews were then ‘the accustomed place’. Somewhat later,
the maps of Höfnagel (<i>c.</i> 1560) and Agas (<i>c.</i> 1570) show,
in addition to the Bull ring already mentioned, another ring marked
‘The Beare bayting’, standing immediately west of it, and like it in
the Clink.<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> The animals at the stake are discernible in the rings,
and to the south of each stretches a yard with a pond in the middle and
kennelled dogs along the sides. It is in the Clink, too, that Norden
in 1593 shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span> ‘The Beare howse’, a little west and north of ‘The play
howse’, which is the Rose. This evidence is consistent with what little
is upon written record about the locality of the Bear Gardens. The most
important document is a deposition of John Taylor, not the water-poet,
in a suit of 1620:<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘He saith that he remembreth that the game of bear-bayting hath
been kept in fower severall places (vizt.) at Mason Steares on
the bankside; neere Maid-lane by the corner of the Pyke Garden;
at the beare garden which was parcell of the possession of
William Payne; and the place where they are now kept.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Taylor was then an old man of seventy-seven and his
memory would easily go back to the time of the early maps. To his
testimony may be added that of Stowe, who says in his <i>Survey of
London</i> (1598):<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Now to returne to the West banke, there be two Beare gardens,
the olde and new places, wherein be kept Beares, Buls and other
beastes to be bayted. As also Mastiues in severall kenels,
nourished to baite them. These Beares and other Beasts are there
bayted in plottes of ground, scaffolded about for the Beholders
to stand safe. Next on this banke was sometime the Bordello or
stewes.’</p>
</div>

<p>In his <i>Annales</i> Stowe records the fall of ‘the old and under
propped scaffolds round about the Beare-garden, commonly called
Paris garden’, and the consequent death of eight persons, at 4 p.m.
on Sunday, 13 January 1583. It was, he says, ‘a friendly warning to
such as more delight themselves in the cruelty of beasts, than in the
works of mercy, the fruits of a true professed faith, which ought to
be the Sabbath day’s exercise’.<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> Dr. Dee also noted the accident
in his diary, and it was reported to Burghley on the next day by the
Lord Mayor and on 19 January by Recorder Fleetwood.<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> Both of
these adopt the view expressed by Stowe that it must be regarded as
divine punishment for the violation of the Sabbath, and Fleetwood
refers to ‘a booke sett downe vpon the same matter’, which may be
John Field’s <i>Godly Exhortation by Occasion of the late Judgment of
God showed at Paris Garden</i>. The shrewd irony of Sir Thomas More,
upon a similar event,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span> when it was the church that fell, many years
before at Beverley, found little echo in the mind of the Elizabethan
Puritan.<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> A further letter from the Lord Mayor to the Privy
Council on 3 July 1583 states that by then the Paris Garden scaffolds
were ‘new builded’.<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a></p>

<p>I find it very difficult to say which of the numerous bear gardens
mentioned by Taylor and Stowe was in use at any given time. Mr. Rendle
thought that Taylor’s first two, that at Mason Stairs and that at the
corner of the Pike Garden, were the two shown as ‘The bolle bayting’
and ‘The Bearebayting’ by Agas.<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a> If so, they are quite out of
scale. This is likely, since they are drawn large enough to show the
animals. They are shown east and west of each other. Rendle puts the
Pike Garden due south of Mason Stairs, but it clearly extended more to
the east in 1587. In any case both these earlier sites were farther
to the west of the Clink than the Hope. Where then was the place on
William Payne’s ground? Mr. Rendle, after a careful comparison of
Rocque’s map of 1746 and other later maps, puts it at ‘the north
courtelage in the lane known as the Bear Garden’ and the Hope at the
south courtelage in the same lane.<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> I take him to mean that the
Bear Garden on Payne’s ground was that in use until 1613, and that
the Hope was built a little to the south of it. The terms of the
contract with Katherens, however, suggest that the same or practically
the same site was used. Mr. Rendle adds that ‘William Payne’s place
next the Thames can be traced back into the possession of John Allen,
until it came down to Edward Alleyn, and was sold by him at a large
profit to Henslowe; the same for which Morgan Pope in 1586 paid to
the Vestry of St. Saviour’s “6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> by the year for
tithes”.’<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> This I cannot quite follow. There seem to have been
two properties standing respectively next and next but one on the
west to the ‘little Rose’. Next the Rose stood messuages called The
Barge, Bell and Cock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span> They were leased by the Bishop of Winchester to
William Payne in 1540. His widow Joan Payne assigned them to John White
and John Malthouse on 1 August 1582, and White’s moiety was assigned
to Malthouse on 5 February 1589.<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> From him Henslowe bought the
lease in 1593–4.<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> The tenements upon it were in his hands as ‘Mr.
Malthowes rentes’ in 1603 and Alleyn was living in one of them.<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a>
And the lease of the Barge, Bell and Cock passed to Alleyn and was
assigned by his will towards the settlement of his second or third
wife, Constance, daughter of Dean Donne.’<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> To the west of this
property in 1540 was a tenement once held by the prioress of Stratford.
This passed to the Crown, and then to Thomas and Isabella Keyes under
a Crown lease which was in Henslowe’s hands by 1597. Some notes of
deeds&mdash;leases, deputations, bonds&mdash;concerning the Bear Garden were left
by Alleyn. Four of the deeds have since been found by Mr. Kingsford
in the Record Office. It appears that, before Henslowe, both Pope and
Burnaby had some of the Keyes land on a sub-lease, and that Burnaby
probably had the Keyes lease itself. Payne carried on baiting in a ring
just south of the Barge. The site was called Orchard Court in 1620,
and stood north of the Hope. This agrees with the relation suggested
by Mr. Rendle between the two courtelages’. The object of the suit of
1620 was to determine whether the Hope also stood upon episcopal, or
upon Crown land. Taylor’s testimony was ambiguous. But it follows that
the transfer southwards must have been due to a tenant who held under
both leases. It was suggested in 1620 that Pope rebuilt the scaffold
standings round the ring as galleries with a larger circuit. This was
doubtless after the ruin of 1583. Nothing is said of a change of site
at this time. Moreover, both Pope and Burnaby seem to have used the
site of the Hope and its bull-house as a dog-yard. Probably, therefore,
the change was made by Henslowe and Alleyn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[465]</span> Alleyn left a record of
‘what the Bear garden cost me for my owne part in December 1594’. He
paid £200 to Burnaby, perhaps only for a joint interest with Henslowe
or Jacob Meade, and £250 for the ‘patten’, that is, I suppose, the
Mastership bought from Sir William Stuart in 1604. He held his interest
for sixteen years and received £60 a year, and then sold it to ‘my
father Hinchloe’ for £580 in February 1611.<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> There must have been
considerable outgoings on the structure during this period. Another
memorandum in Alleyn’s hand shows an expenditure of £486 4<i>s.</i>
10<i>d.</i> during 1602–5, and a further expenditure during 1606–8 of
£360 ‘p<sup>d</sup>. for ye building of the howses’.<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> This last doubtless
refers in part, not to the baiting ring itself, but to a tavern and
office built on ‘the foreside of the messuage or tenemente called the
Beare garden, next the river of Thames in the parish of St. Saviors’,
for which there exists a contract of 2 June 1606 between Henslowe and
Alleyn and Peter Street the carpenter.<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> But this only cost £65,
and it seems to me most likely that the Bear Garden was rebuilt on the
southern site at the same time. Further light is thrown on the profits
of the Bear Garden by a note in Henslowe’s diary that the receipts at
it for the three days next after Christmas 1608 were £4, £6, and £3
14<i>s.</i>, which may be compared with the average of £1 18<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i> received from the Fortune during the same three days.<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a>
It may be added that Crowley notes the ‘bearwardes vaile’ somewhat
ambiguously as ½<i>d.</i>, 1<i>d.</i>, or 2<i>d.</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> and that
Lambarde in 1596 includes Paris Garden with the Theatre and Bel Savage
as a place where you must pay ‘one pennie at the gate, another at the
entrie of the scaffolde, and the thirde for a quiet standinge’.<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a></p>

<p>Yet another building enterprise was undertaken in 1613, by which time
an interest in the property had certainly been leased to Jacob Meade.
On 29 August a contract was entered into between Henslowe and Meade and
Gilbert Katherens, carpenter, for the pulling down of the Bear Garden
and the erection before the following 30 November<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[466]</span> on or near the same
site of a play-house on the model of the Swan, but with a movable
stage, so as to enable the building to be used also for baitings. I
reproduce the document here from Dr. Greg’s text:<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">The execution of the contract must have been delayed,
for the rebuilt Bear Garden is fairly to be identified with the Hope,
of which no mention is made in the petition of the spring of 1614
described by Taylor in <i>The True Cause of the Watermen’s Suit</i>,
although it had certainly come into use by the following autumn.<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a>
Here was arranged for 7 October a trial of wit between this same Taylor
and the shifty rhymer William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span> Fennor.<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> The latter failed to turn
up, and Taylor, who, according to his own account, had advertised ‘this
Bear Garden banquet of dainty conceits’ and collected a great audience,
was left ‘in a greater puzzell then the blinde beare in the midst of
all her whip-broth’. After acting part of what he had intended, he
resigned the stage to the regular company:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Then came the players, and they play’d an act,</div>
        <div>Which greatly from my action did detract,</div>
        <div>For ’tis not possible for any one</div>
        <div>To play against a company alone,</div>
        <div>And such a company (I’ll boldly say)</div>
        <div>That better (nor the like) e’r played a play.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">This company was no doubt the Lady Elizabeth’s, as
reconstituted in the previous March under an agreement with Nathaniel
Field on their behalf, of which a mutilated copy exists. To it Meade
was a party, and there is nothing to establish a connexion between
Meade and any other theatre than the Hope.<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> Jonson names the
Lady Elizabeth’s men as the actors of <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, and
in the Induction thereto, after a dialogue between the Stage-keeper,
who is taunted with ‘gathering up the broken apples for the beares
within’, and the Book-holder, a Scrivener reads ‘Articles of Agreement,
indented, between the Spectators or Hearers, at the Hope on the
Bankeside, in the County of Surrey on the one party; and the Author
of Bartholmew Fayre in the said place, and County on the other party:
the one and thirtieth day of Octob. 1614’. According to Jonson the
locality was suitable for a play on Bartholomew Fair, for it was ‘as
durty as <i>Smithfield</i>, and as stinking euery whit’.<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> There
were disputes between Henslowe and the company, partly arising out of
an arrangement that they should ‘lie still’ one day a fortnight for the
baiting, and the combination broke up. Some of its members, apparently
then Prince Charles’s men, are found after Henslowe’s death signing an
agreement with Alleyn and Meade to play at the Hope, and to set aside
a fourth of the gallery takings towards a sum of £200 to be accepted
in discharge of their debt to Henslowe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[470]</span> Alleyn had of course resumed
his part proprietorship of the house as executor and ultimate heir to
Henslowe. Meade probably took actual charge of the theatre, and there
is an undated letter from Prince Charles’s men to Alleyn, written
possibly in 1617, in which they explain their removal from the Bankside
as due to the intemperate action of his partner in taking from them
the day which by course was theirs. I suppose that this dispute also
was due to the competition of baiting with the plays. In 1619 some
disputes between Alleyn and Meade had to be settled by arbitration,
and from Alleyn’s memoranda in connexion with these it appears that
Meade was his deputy under his patent as Master of the Game, and had
also a lease from him of the house at £100 a year.<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> The Hope is
mentioned from time to time, chiefly as a place of baiting, up to the
civil wars.<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> It is one of the three Bankside theatres alluded
to in <i>Holland’s Leaguer</i> (1632), where it is described as ‘a
building of excellent hope’ for players, wild beasts, and gladiators.
Bear-baiting was suppressed by the House of Commons in 1642,<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a>
and the house was dismantled in 1656. The manuscript continuation of
Stowe’s <i>Annales</i> describes its end and the slaughter of the
bears, but gives the date of its erection erroneously as 1610 instead
of 1613.<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a></p>

<p>After the Restoration the Bear Garden was restored, and a lane called
Bear Gardens, running from Bankside to New Park Street, and a sign
therein of The White Bear still mark its name.<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> Its site is pretty
well defined in the seventeenth-century maps as to the west of the
Globe and, where that is shown, the Rose, and generally as a little
nearer Maid Lane than the latter. This is consistent with a notice in
the Sewers records for 5 December 1595 of a sewer which ran to the Bear
Garden from a garden known to have lain a little farther east along
Maid Lane than the Globe.<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span></p>

<p>The traditional day for baiting was Sunday. Crowley in 1550 describes
it as taking place on ‘euerye Sondaye’.<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> Naturally this did not
pass without Puritan comment, to which point was given by the fall
of Paris Garden on a Sunday in 1583.<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a> A general prohibition of
shows on Sunday seems to have followed, from which it is not likely
that bear-baiting was excepted. It may be inferred that Thursday
was substituted, for a Privy Council order of 25 July 1591 called
attention, not only to a neglect of the rule as to Sunday, but also
to the fact that every day ‘the players do use to recite their plays
to the great hurt and destruction of the game of bear-baiting and
like pastimes, which are maintained for Her Majesty’s pleasure if
occasion require’, and forbade plays both on Sunday and on Thursday,
on which day ‘those other games usually have been always accustomed
and practised’.<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> Henslowe’s diary seems to show that up to 1597
he kept the Sunday prohibition and disregarded the Thursday one,
which is a little odd, as he was interested in the Bear Garden.
But a proclamation of 7 May 1603 on the accession of James repeats
the warning that there was neglect of the Sabbath, and renews the
prohibition both for baiting and for plays.<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> Henslowe and Alleyn
in their petition of about 1607 for increased fees lay stress on this
restraint as a main factor in their alleged loss.<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> It seems from
the notes of Stowe’s manuscript <i>continuator</i> that during the
first half of the seventeenth century Tuesday and Thursday became the
regular baiting days.<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a> But the agreements made by Henslowe and
Meade with the Lady Elizabeth’s men in 1614 profess only to reserve one
day in fourteen for this purpose, of which apparently notice was to be
given on the previous Monday.<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a></p>

<p class="p-left">The statements made in the patent as to the objects of
the promoters can be confirmed from other sources. We know that the
lease of the Whitefriars expired at the end of 1614, that there had
been an amalgamation of the Queen’s Revels and the Lady Elizabeth’s men
in 1613, and that in all probability this arrangement was extended to
bring in Prince Charles’s men during 1615. Unfortunately for Rosseter
and his associates, the patent had hardly been granted before it was
called in question. Presumably the inhabitants of the Blackfriars,
who had already one theatre in their midst, thought that that one was
enough. At any rate the Corporation approached the Privy Council, and
alleged divers inconveniences, in particular the fact that the theatre,
which was described as ‘in Puddle Wharfe’, would ‘adjoine so neere
vnto’ the church of St. Anne’s as to disturb the congregation.<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a>
The Council referred the patent to the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Edward
Coke, no friend of players, or of the royal prerogative which expressed
itself in patents; and when he found a technical flaw, in that the
Blackfriars, having been brought within the City jurisdiction by the
charter of 1608, was not strictly within ‘the suburbs’, ordered on
26 September 1615 that the building, which had already been begun,
should be discontinued. Nevertheless, the work must have gone so far
as to permit of the production of plays, for the title-page of Field’s
<i>Amends for Ladies</i> (1618) testifies that it was acted ‘at the
Blacke-Fryers both by the Princes Servants and the Lady Elizabeths’.
Moreover, on 27 January 1617 the Privy Council wrote again to the Lord
Mayor, enjoining him to see to the suppression of a play-house in the
Blackfriars ‘neere vnto his Majestyes Wardrobe’, which is said to be
‘allmost if not fully finished’.<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[474]</span></p>

<p>It does not appear possible to say exactly where in the Blackfriars’
precinct the Porter’s Hall once occupied by Lady Saunders stood. It
was certainly not the porter’s lodge at the north-west corner of the
great cloister, for this was still in 1615, as it had been since 1554,
part of the Cobham house. One Ninian Sawnders, a vintner, took a lease
of the chancel of the old conventual church from Sir Thomas Cawarden
in 1553, and this would have been close to St. Anne’s, which stood at
the north-east corner of the great cloister. But Ninian died in 1553
and never got knighted. On the other hand, the rooms on the south
side of the great cloister, generally described as Lygon’s lodgings,
had been in the tenure of one Nicholas Saunders shortly before their
sale by Sir George More to John Freeman and others in 1609. Nicholas
Saunders is said to have been knighted in 1603.<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> These lodgings
adjoined More’s own mansion house, and might at some time have served
as a lodge for his porter.<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> But I do not feel that they would very
naturally be described either as ‘near’ or ‘in’ Puddle Wharf, or as
‘near’ the Wardrobe. These indications suggest some building approached
either from Puddle Wharf proper or from the hill, afterwards known as
St. Andrew’s Hill, which ran up from it to the Wardrobe, outside the
eastern wall of the Priory precinct. The Cawarden estate did not extend
to this wall, and the Saunders family may quite well, in addition to
Lygon’s lodgings, have had a house, either on the site of the old
convent gardens, or higher up the hill on the Blackwell estate, near
where Shakespeare’s house stood, and near also to St. Anne’s. Perhaps
there had been a porter’s lodge on the east of the old prior’s house.</p>

THE PRIVATE THEATRES</h3>
</div>

<h5>i. THE BLACKFRIARS</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;Many documents bearing upon the
history of the theatre are preserved at Loseley, and the most
important are collected by Professor A. Feuillerat in vol. ii
of the <i>Malone Society’s Collections</i> (1913). A few had
been already printed or described by A. J. Kempe in <i>The
Loseley Manuscripts</i> (1835), by J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps
in <i>Outlines</i>, i. 299, by J. C. Jeaffreson in the 7th
<i>Report of the Hist. MSS. Commission</i> (1879), by Professor
Feuillerat himself in <i>Shakespeare-Jahrbuch</i>, xlviii
(1912), 81, and by C. W. Wallace, with extracts from others,
in <i>The Evolution of the English Drama up to Shakespeare</i>
(1912, cited as Wallace, i). In the same book and in <i>The
Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars</i> (1908, cited as
Wallace, ii), Professor Wallace prints or extracts documents
from other sources, chiefly lawsuits in the Court of Requests
and elsewhere, which supplement those discovered by J.
Greenstreet and printed in F. G. Fleay, <i>Chronicle History
of the London Stage</i> (1890). The references to the theatre
in J. P. Collier, <i>History of English Dramatic Poetry</i>
(1837 and 1879), are seriously contaminated by forgeries.
Some material for the general history of the precinct is
furnished in the various editions of John Stowe, <i>Survey of
London</i> (1598, 1603, ed. Munday, 1618, ed. Strype, 1720, ed.
Kingsford, 1908), in W. Dugdale, <i>Monasticon</i> (1817–30),
by M. Reddan in the <i>Victoria History of London</i>, i. 498,
and in the <i>Athenaeum</i> (1886), ii. 91. A. W. Clapham,
<i>On the Topography of the Dominican Priory of London</i>
(<i>Archaeologia</i>, lxiii. 57), gives a valuable account of
the history and church of the convent, but had not the advantage
of knowing the Loseley documents, and completely distorts the
plan of the domestic buildings and the theatre. An account by
J. Q. Adams is in <i>S. P.</i> xiv (1917), 64. The status of
the liberty is discussed by V. C. Gildersleeve, <i>Government
Regulation of the Elizabethan Drama</i>, 143.]</p>
</div>

<p>The Dominicans, also called the ‘preaching’ or ‘black’ friars, came
to England in 1221. Their first house was in Holborn.<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> In 1275
they acquired a site on the sloping ground between St. Paul’s and the
river, just to the east of Fleet ditch, and obtained leave to divert
the walls of the City so as to furnish a north and north-west boundary
to their precinct. Here grew up a very famous convent, the motherhouse
of all the Dominican settlements in the country. It received favours
from several sovereigns, notably from Edward I and his Queen Eleanor,
who were regarded as its founders; and in return held its great
buildings available for national purposes. In 1322–3 it furnished a
depository for state records. It housed divers parliaments, at first
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span> its church and later in a great chamber which will be of singular
interest to us, and from as early as 1311 was often found a convenient
meeting-place for the Privy Council. In 1522 it was the lodging of the
Emperor Charles V, and a wooden bridge and gallery were carried over
the Fleet, to facilitate communications with his train in Bridewell
palace. In 1529 its parliament chamber was the scene of the legatine
sittings which tried the case of divorce between the same Emperor’s
niece Katharine and the conscience-stricken Henry VIII.<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a></p>

<p>By this time the friars had ceased to be a power in the land. Those
of the convent had numbered seventy in 1315; there were no more than
sixteen or seventeen in 1538.<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a> Parts of the buildings, now
all too spacious, were let out as residences. It was, perhaps, the
neighbourhood of the Wardrobe, whose Master had an official residence
contiguous to the east wall of the precinct, which made the Blackfriars
a favourite locality for those about the Court. A list of ‘them that
hath lodgings within the Blak Freers’, which was drawn up in 1522,
probably in connexion with the imperial visit, contains the names of
Lord Zouch of Harringworth, Lord Cobham, Sir William Kingston, then
carver and afterwards comptroller of the household, Sir Henry Wyatt,
afterwards treasurer of the chamber, Sir William Parr, Sir Thomas
Cheyne, afterwards warden of the Cinque ports and treasurer of the
household, Jane, widow of Sir Richard Guildford, formerly master of
the horse, and Christopher More, a clerk of the exchequer.<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> It
is to be feared that some of these tenants cast a covetous eye upon
the fee-simple of their dwellings, and that it was not all zeal for
church reform which made Lord Cobham, for example, write to Sir Thomas
Wyatt, the poet and son of Sir Henry, on 7 October 1538, ‘No news,
but I trust there shall not be a friar left in England before you
return’.<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> Cobham and his friends had not long to wait. The deed
by which the friars surrendered their property into the hands of the
King is dated 12 November 1538. The annual income, derived from the
rented premises, was reckoned as £104 15<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, but of
course this in no way represents the capital value of the site and
buildings.<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> The partition of spoils, under the supervision of
the Court of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span> Augmentations, followed in due course. Cobham got his
house, although not immediately, at nine years’ purchase; and between
1540 and 1550 some sixteen other parcels of the estate, many of them
very substantial, were similarly alienated.<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> Finally, on 12 March
1550, during the liberal distribution of crown lands for which the
authority of Henry VIII was alleged by his executors in the Privy
Council, a comprehensive grant was made of all that still remained
unalienated in the precinct to Sir Thomas Cawarden, the Master of the
Revels, whose office had for some years past been established within
its walls. Apparently Cawarden paid nothing for it, but on the other
hand the King owed him a good deal for moneys spent in the service of
the Revels.<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a></p>

<p>The Blackfriars long remained an anomaly in the local government of
London. Like all monastic establishments, the friars had maintained
extensive privileges within their own precinct. Nightly their porter
had shut their four gates upon the city. They had done their own
paving. The Lord Mayor had claimed a jurisdiction, but if this was
admitted, it was only in cases of felony. The ordinary functions of
civil magistracy had been exercised, when called for, by Sir William
Kingston and other important tenants.<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> Naturally there had been
friction from time to time with the Corporation, and on the surrender
the latter, like the tenants, hoped that their opportunity was come.
They addressed a petition to Henry, in which they expressed their
gratification that he had ‘extirped and extinct the orders of Freers
to the great exaltacion of Crystes doctryne and the abolucion of
Antecriste theyr first founder and begynner’, and asked for a grant of
the church and the whole precinct of the Blackfriars, together with
those of the three other London friaries, to be used for the special
benefit of non-parishioners and of those infected by pestilence.<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a>
Henry, however, had not gone to the trouble of obtaining a surrender
merely to inflate the powers and the revenues of a municipality. He
is reported to have replied that ‘he was as well hable to keep the
liberties as the Friers were’, and to have handed the keys to Sir
John Portinari, one of his gentlemen pensioners, who dwelt in the
precinct.<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a> The Blackfriars, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[478]</span> continued to be an exempt
place or ‘liberty’, an enclave within the walls of the City, but not
part of it, and with a somewhat loose and ill-defined organization
of its own. The inhabitants agreed together and appointed a porter
and a scavenger. A constable was appointed for them by the justices
of the verge.<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> The precinct was constituted an ecclesiastical
parish, known as St. Anne’s after a chapel which had once served its
inhabitants; and was provided with a church.<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> Petty offences
were tried, and any exceptional affairs managed, as might have been
done in a rural parish, by the justices, and it was to these that
any administrative orders thought necessary by the Privy Council
were ordinarily addressed.<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> It perhaps goes without saying that
the City were not content with a single rebuff. They attempted to
interfere at the time of a riot in 1551, and were snubbed by the Privy
Council.<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> Under Mary they promoted legislation with a view to
annexing the liberties, but without success.<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> In 1562 a sheriff,
who entered the liberty to enforce a proclamation, was shut in by the
prompt action of the constable, and faced with an inhibition which
one of the justices hurried to obtain from a privy councillor.<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a>
The city remained persistent. In 1574 the Council had again to
intervene.<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a> In 1578 a controversy arose as to the right of the
City to dispose of the goods of felons and other escheats. It was
referred to two chief justices, who made a report to the effect that,
while the inhabitants of both the Blackfriars and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[479]</span> the Whitefriars
enjoyed certain immunities from civic levies and liabilities,
nevertheless the soil of the precincts lay within the City, and the
City was entitled to exercise jurisdiction therein. It may be doubted
whether effect was given to this opinion.<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a></p>

<p>In 1587 the Council ordered another inquiry, in order to ascertain
the precise nature of the Queen’s title in the Blackfriars.<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a>
There had been a petition for redress of inconveniences from the
inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> About the same time the chief landowner, Sir William
More, appears to have suggested that the liberty should be converted
into a manor, and manorial rights conferred upon him.<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a> These are
signs that residence in a liberty hard by a thronging population had
disclosed a seamy side. Undesirable persons were bound to throng to a
district where the Lord Mayor’s writ did not run. An open space, for
example, filled with immemorial trees planted by the friars, had been
ruined to house alleys for bowling and other unlawful games.<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>
Doubtless there were those who resented the fact that the attempt of
the City to discourage interludes had been met by the establishment of
a Blackfriars theatre in 1576, which lasted until 1584. It appears to
have been a protest from the inhabitants which led the Privy Council
to forbid the public theatre contemplated by James Burbage in 1596,
although some years later they winked at the opening of the building
as a private house. In 1596 the church fell down, and in appointing a
commission to apportion the responsibility for repairs, the council
also instructed them to consider the government of the liberty, ‘which
being grown more populus than heretofore and without any certaine and
knowen officer to keepe good orders there, needeth to be reformed in
that behalfe’.<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> The nature of the commission’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span> findings is not
upon record, but that the ultimate solution lay in the incorporation
of the liberty in the City could hardly be doubtful. As far back as
1589 the Council had found it convenient to use the Lord Mayor as
an agent for securing a proper contribution from the Blackfriars
towards a levy. From 1597 onwards they showed an increased tendency to
make similar use of an administrative machinery far more completely
organized than that of the justices of the peace. In that year the Lord
Mayor was instructed to make a collection in aid of the Blackfriars
church repairs. In 1600 it again fell to him to assess the share of
the liberty in a levy of men and money. In 1601 it is he who is called
upon to suppress plays in Blackfriars during Lent.<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> The final step
was, however, deferred until 20 September 1608, when the new Jacobean
charter formally extended the jurisdiction of the city to various
liberties, including both the Blackfriars and the Whitefriars, with
certain exemptions as regards assessments and the tenure of offices,
but with none as regards responsibility for petty offences and the
keeping of the peace.<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a></p>

<p>I have anticipated, in order to get the question of jurisdiction out
of the way. I must now return to the topography. Sir Thomas Cawarden
died on 29 August 1559. He had no son, and his executors, Lady Cawarden
and Sir William More, personally took over the Blackfriars estate in
survivorship, as part of the settlement of his affairs.<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> Lady
Cawarden’s death on 20 February 1560 left More sole owner. He retained
the property until his own death in 1601, and the muniment room of his
house at Loseley near Guildford contains innumerable documents relating
to the business transactions in which it involved him, together with
some of earlier date which he inherited from Cawarden. The researches
of Professor Feuillerat in these archives render it possible to
reconstruct with some minuteness the arrangement of the Blackfriars
and its buildings at the time of the surrender, to trace many of the
changes of the next half-century, and, as part of the process, to
indicate pretty definitely the locality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[481]</span> and nature of the structures
which were turned to theatrical uses.</p>

<p>The precinct covered a space of about five acres.<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> In shape it was
a rough parallelogram, wider at the north than at the south. The great
gate was towards the east end of the north boundary. It was reached
by a short entry on the south of Bowier Row, now Ludgate Hill, just
east of Ludgate. This seems to have been called Gate Street. It is now
the north end of Pilgrim Street.<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> From here the boundary was the
city wall, westwards for about 450 ft. to the Fleet ditch, and then
southwards for about 800 ft. along the east side of the ditch. There
were towers at intervals. One of these stood about 200 ft. down from
the angle, and immediately south of this was the bridge over the Fleet
towards Bridewell. The south and east boundaries were also walled.
Between the south wall and the river ran Castle Lane, which was not
within the precinct.<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> A gate in the south wall gave access across
the lane to the Blackfriars ‘bridge’ or ‘stairs’, a common landing
place, originally built by the Prior of St. John’s, from whom, in some
way not clear to me, the Friars held their estate.<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> The south-east
angle of the precinct was near Puddle Wharf, and from here the boundary
ran up the west side of St. Andrew’s Hill to Carter Lane, bending out
eastwards near the top, where the buildings of the Wardrobe joined it
by an arch over the roadway, was then driven in sharply westwards by
the end of Carter Lane, which was butt up against a turngate in the
friars’ wall, and finally ran in an irregularly diagonal line from the
junction of Creed and Carter Lanes north-west to the great gate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[482]</span> again.
Internally the precinct was unequally divided by an irregular highway
which ran north and south, from the great gate to the Blackfriars
stairs. This started out of Gate Street as High Street, and lower down
became Water Lane.<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a> All the conventual buildings lay on the east
of the highway. Here was the larger division of the precinct, measuring
about 450 ft. from east to west. The western division, measuring about
150 ft., contained only a few houses and gardens. Across it ran from
Bridewell Bridge to Water Lane a strip of unoccupied land, containing
nothing but a ruined gallery, probably part of the provision made
for the accommodation of Charles V in 1522. One of Cawarden’s first
acts, when he got his property, was to make a new road, with tenements
and gardens to the south of it, along this strip. It became known as
Bridewell Lane, and is represented by the present Union Street.<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a>
It must have joined Water Lane just south of a little place or
<i>parvis</i> which lay in front of the west porch of the church and
the adjoining entrance to the cloister. The <i>parvis</i> contained one
or two houses and shops, and formed part of the continuous thoroughfare
from north to south, communicating by gateways with High Street and
Water Lane.<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> The conventual church itself divided the eastern
portion of the precinct from west to east, extending not quite so
far east as the present Friar Street. It was 220 ft. long and 66 ft.
wide, and had two aisles and a chancel, which, as usual in conventual
churches, was as long as the nave. There was a square porch tower over
the west end. Over the junction of nave and chancel stood a belfry,
visible in Wyngaerde’s drawing of <i>c.</i> 1543–50, and to the north
of the chancel a chapel, probably the quasi-parochial chapel of St.
Anne, and a vestry.<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> Beyond these was the churchyard.<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a> This
was 300 ft. long by 90 ft. deep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[483]</span> and occupied about two-thirds of the
space between the High Street on the west, the church on the south,
and the north-eastern boundary of the precinct. A group of houses
stood between it and the great gate towards Ludgate, and three others
separated it from the High Street at the south west corner.<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> One
of these, built up against the church and the High Street gateway, was
a recluse’s cell or Ankerhouse.<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> Cawarden cut a new road across
the churchyard, 20 ft. north of the site of the chancel and just north
of the Ankerhouse and the High Street gate. This continued Carter Lane,
the turngate at the end of which was converted into a gate practicable
for carts, and with Bridewell Lane provided a thoroughfare across the
Blackfriars from east to west in addition to that from north to south.
That part of the existing Carter Lane, west of Creed Lane, which was
formerly known as Shoemakers’ Row, doubtless represents Cawarden’s new
way.[1494]</p>

<p>On the south of the nave stood the great cloister, entered by a
porter’s lodge in its north-west corner. It was 110 ft. square. Its
eastern alley was probably in a line with a way across the church under
the belfry to a door into the churchyard, and this line, preserved by
Cawarden in order to provide access to the cloister from his new way,
is represented by the existing Church Entry.<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> The north side of
the cloister was formed by the wall of the nave. Behind the other three
sides were ranged the domestic buildings of the convent. On the east
were the ample Prior’s lodging, which stretched back over the space
south of the chancel, and farther to the south the Convent garden,
covering an acre. Over part of this lodging and over the cloister alley
itself was the east dorter of the friars, communicating direct with
the church by a stairway.<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> The east side of the cloister also
contained the Chapter-house, which probably stood in the middle, and to
the south of this a school-house.<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a> Behind the south-east corner
were the provincial’s lodging, a store-house, the common jakes, and
another garden, known as the hill garden.<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[484]</span> Another dorter stood
over the south cloister alley and over some ground-floor buildings of
uncertain use, which divided this alley from an inner cloister, flanked
on the east by the library, and in part on the west by the infirmary,
behind which were the bakehouse, brewhouse, and stables. The western
end of the south alley of the main cloister formed a lavabo, and was
apparently sunk to a lower level than the rest.<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> Down the western
side of both cloisters extended a continuous range of buildings, the
details of which will require subsequent examination. These formed two
main blocks. The northern, flanking the main cloister, contained the
buttery and parts of the guest-house and porter’s lodge; the southern,
flanking the inner cloister, was devoted to the refectory, the lower
end of which, owing to the slope of the hill, seems to have stood over
the infirmary. The irregular outline of Water Lane, jutting a good deal
to the west after it emerged from the <i>parvis</i> in front of the
church porch, left a space of some 84 ft. at its widest between this
range of buildings and the lane itself. The guest-house and porter’s
lodge extended back into this space; it also held the convent kitchen
and other subsidiary buildings.<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a></p>

<p>When Cawarden got his grant in 1550, a great deal of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[485]</span> property had
already been disposed of.[1501] Except for the strip where he laid
out Bridewell Lane and two small garden plots, nothing was left for
him in the western division of the precinct. To the north the group
of houses between the churchyard and the great gate had gone. To
the south, Cobham had taken the rooms over the porter’s lodge, with
a closet window looking into the church, and he and one Sir George
Harper had divided the rest of the guest-house block&mdash;‘fayer great
edifices’, says Cawarden&mdash;that lay behind.[1502] Sir Francis Bryan had
taken the Prior’s lodging and the convent garden, and from him they
had passed to the Bishop of Ely and then to one William Blackwell.
Lady Kingston had taken the inner cloister, with part of the south
dorter and the rooms beneath it, the library, the infirmary, the
brewhouse, bakehouse, and stables. Others had taken the school-house,
some more of the south dorter, the provincial’s lodging, the jakes,
the store-house, and the hill garden, and these ultimately passed to
Lady Grey. Sir Thomas Cheyne, the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, had
taken some of the buildings west of the frater. Everything farther
south, down towards the river, had also been alienated. What was left
for Cawarden consisted mainly of the church itself and the churchyard,
the ankerhouse, the great cloister, the chapter-house, the east dorter,
the porter’s lodge and buttery block, with all the rooms over these
except Cobham’s, the frater, the kitchen, and such buildings standing
between the frater and Water Lane, as did not belong to Cheyne.<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>
Much trouble was caused to Cawarden’s successors by uncertainty as to
the extent of Cheyne’s claim.[1504] No doubt the grant constituted
Cawarden the chief landowner in the district, but he complained that
hardly any of his property was ‘mansionable’, and even at the time of
his death he had only brought the annual value up to £70.<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> The
survey taken for the purposes of the grant puts it at no more than £19.
On the other hand, the value of the stone and timber and other material
of the buildings is estimated in the same survey at £879 3<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i>, including an item of £709 11<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> for lead
alone. Evidently it was from the site-value and the judicious erection
of new buildings and conversion of old ones, with the aid of this
material, into ‘mansionable’ property, that Cawarden’s profit was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[486]</span>
come. A convinced Protestant, he looked upon the church as a quarry. He
pulled it down, with the exception of the south wall of the nave, which
was to serve him as a garden wall, and the porch which he turned into a
tenement. Other tenements were built on the site, and the rest of it,
with so much of the churchyard as was not required for the new road,
was let off. One of the tenants appears to have made tennis-courts on
the site of the chancel. The demolition included St. Anne’s Chapel.
This had been closed during Henry’s reign and used as a store-house
for the Offices of Tents and Revels. For a while the inhabitants were
allowed to worship in a room under an old gallery, presumably that
which became the site of Bridewell Lane; but now this passed into
Cawarden’s hands and he evicted them. When they plucked up heart, under
Mary, to protest, he first offered them a site in the churchyard and
a roof if they would be at the expense of building, and ultimately
gave them an upper room, apparently at the north end of the east
dorter. This fell down in 1597, and was rebuilt by the parishioners,
who finally bought it, with a piece of the site of the old conventual
church as a churchyard, from Sir George More in 1607–8.<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> Cawarden
effected an adjustment of boundaries on the east of the cloister with
the Bishop of Ely.<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> He then proceeded to build dwelling rooms
along the south and east sides of the cloister.<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> They must have
been fairly shallow, for they left him a great square garden, but
no doubt the recess of the chapter-house permitted increased depth
towards the east. Under the west wing of the new building, adjoining
the buttery, was a great vaulted room, 57 ft. by 25, which must, I
think, have been the lavabo of the friars.[1509] East of this was a
set of rooms capable of use as a separate dwelling, which came to be
known as Lygon’s lodgings.<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a> The rest formed the capital mansion
of the property, the ‘great house’, and was clearly intended for
Cawarden’s own residence. It seems to have been sometimes let and
sometimes occupied by Sir William More.<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> The great garden must
have been pleasant enough, with the north and west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[487]</span> cloister alleys
left standing, and a tinkling conduit in the west end, filled by a pipe
from Clerkenwell.<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a></p>

<p>The important part of the Blackfriars, from the point of view of
theatrical topography, is the range of buildings on the western side of
the two cloisters, parallel to Water Lane. The two blocks constituting
this range, or so much of them as passed to Cawarden, are referred to
in the surveys of 1548 and 1550 as the ‘olde butterie’ and the ‘vpper
ffrater’.<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[488]</span> From the details given in these surveys and in the
leases and other documents preserved at Loseley, it is possible to form
a very fair notion of their structure and uses. The chief rooms in
both blocks were upon an upper floor. The northern block was 110 ft.
in length from north to south and 36 ft. in width. The upper rooms,
however, were only 26 ft. wide, as 10 ft. was taken up by a high stone
gallery which ran along the west of the building, and was perhaps
connected with the wooden gallery leading to the Fleet.<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> These
rooms were four in number. That to the north, 21 ft. long, belonged to
Cobham, and had a closet window looking into the church upon the south
wall of which, for 20 ft. of its width, the block abutted.<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> Then
came two central rooms, a large and a small one, measuring together 52
ft. in length, and then a southern one, which with an entry measured
47 ft.<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> The surveys treat the three rooms which fell to Cawarden
as a single ‘hall place’. All four rooms had probably formed part of
the guest-house of the convent, and had lodged Charles V. The ground
floor held low rooms pierced at intervals by entries and with cellars
underneath them. The chief entry or gate-house was at the southern
end and served Cawarden’s mansion house when that was built.<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a>
North of this came the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[489]</span> buttery proper and a pantry, occupying with a
small entry connecting them 29 ft.;<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> then another stepped entry
into the cloister serving afterwards as Cawarden’s garden gate;<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a>
then probably more rooms under the two central upper rooms; then a
staircase to Cobham’s upper room;<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> and finally rooms belonging to
the porter’s lodge, which were 21 ft. in length. This lodge extended
backwards towards Water Lane, and over and around it were other
rooms of Cobham’s and yet others forming the house of Sir George
Harper.<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> Some or all of these had also probably been part of the
guest-house. Together with a garden of Cobham’s, they occupied rather
less than half the space between the northern block and Water Lane.
South of them, and included in Cawarden’s grant, were the convent
kitchen with a room over it, and the kitchen yard, forming a space 84
ft. wide, and in length 74 ft. at the buttery end and 68 ft. at the
lane end.</p>

<p>The northern block, being 110 ft. long, extended right down to the
southern line of the cloister, which was 110 ft. square. Here it
abutted upon the southern block. This was 52 ft. wide. The length
of the upper frater is given in the surveys as 107 ft., and in two
of More’s leases as 110 ft.<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> The latter figure is probably the
right one.<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> The north end of this block contained a ‘great
stair’, which gave access both to the frater and to the guest-house,
and was itself convenient of approach both from the gate-house entry
and from the lavabo at the south-west angle of the cloister. Probably
this end was built in the form of a tower, as there were rooms on
and over the staircase and over the adjoining Duchy Chamber, and
garrets over those.<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> There was a garret also over the south end
of the northern block.<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> It is doubtful whether anything stood
over the main portion of the southern block.<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a> This had a flat
leaded roof, whereas the northern block, as its lead is not mentioned
in the survey, probably had a gabled and tiled roof. Apart from the
staircase tower,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[490]</span> the upper floor of the southern block consisted of
the ‘upper’ frater or refectory, a spacious apartment, which had been
used for Parliaments and the legatine trial of Henry VIII’s divorce
case, and was sometimes known as ‘the Parliament chamber’.<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> The
ground floor is a little more difficult. The survey of 1548 assigns to
it a ‘blind’, that is, I suppose, a windowless, or at any rate dark,
parlour, which came next the buttery block, and a hall, to which the
parlour served as an entry.<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> These are said to be ‘vnder the seide
frater of the same lengethe and breddethe’. This might naturally be
taken to mean that they were, together, of the same size as the frater
above. In fact it must, I think, mean that they were of the same size
as each other, for we know from another source that the south end of
the frater was over a room not belonging to Cawarden at all but to
Lady Kingston, and itself standing over the infirmary, which, owing
to the fall of the ground, formed at that end a lower story of the
block.<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a> The survey does not say what the sizes of the parlour and
hall were, but a later document suggests that together they underlay
over two-thirds of the frater and occupied a space of 74 ft. from north
to south and 52 ft. from east to west.<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a> Under Cawarden’s part of
the southern block were cellars. To the west lay what was known as the
Duchy Chamber, probably from some official use in connexion with the
Duchy of Lancaster. This was a two-story building, 50 ft. long by 16
ft. wide, jutting out at right angles to the extreme north end of the
frater. South of it was a house, apparently belonging to Sir Thomas
Cheyne and occupied by Sir John Portinari, which touched the frater
at one end, and at the other had a parlour, interposed between the
end of the Duchy Chamber and Water Lane, and bounded on the north, as
the Duchy Chamber itself must have been, by the kitchen yard. South
of this again were a little chamber and a kitchen, with an entry from
Water Lane, probably between Portinari’s parlour and another house
belonging to Cheyne.<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a> The little chamber and kitchen were used
in conjunction with the hall under the upper frater. This hall, which
was paved and stood ‘handsome to’ the buttery, had also been a frater,
serving as a breakfast room for the friars, and in the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[491]</span> chamber
had lived their butler.<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> Now it is noted in the surveys that Sir
Thomas Cheyne had laid claim to the paved hall, the ‘blind’ parlour,
the little chamber, and the kitchen, and it seems very doubtful whether
they were covered by the specifications of Cawarden’s grant.<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> He
succeeded, however, in occupying them; and the inevitable lawsuit was
left for his successor.</p>

<p>Cawarden had had the buttery, frater, kitchen, and Duchy chamber
on lease since 4 April 1548.<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a> Some of these, as well as other
conventual buildings, he had occupied from a still earlier date in
his capacity as Master of the Tents and Revels. For these offices the
propinquity of the Wardrobe rendered the Blackfriars very convenient.
Already in 1511 temporary use had been made of some room in the
precinct to prepare a pageant in for a joust at Westminster.<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a>
Before Cawarden became Master, the regular store-house of the Revels
office had been at Warwick Inn.<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a> The transfer to Blackfriars
was not completed until February 1547, but it perhaps began earlier,
since the papers of the Court of Augmentations contain receipts by
John Barnard, for sums spent by the King’s surveyor on ‘the reparayng
and amendyng of the Blacke Fryers in London store howse for the seyd
tentes and revelles’ during 1545.<a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a> The Chapel of St. Anne had
been requisitioned with other houses ‘to laye in tentes, maskes and
revels’ before the end of Henry VIII’s reign.<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a> As to the exact
location of the Tents there is some interesting, although conflicting,
evidence. An order of the Augmentations in 1550 allowed Sir Thomas
Cheyne £5 a year for the use of his great room by the Tents from
25 March 1545 onwards.<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a> The room intended was undeniably the
paved hall or breakfast room under the frater, but Sir William More
maintained in 1572 that the payment by the Augmentations was an
irregular one, and that the paved hall had never been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[492]</span> used for the
Revels and was never in fact Cheyne’s.<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> Sir John Portinari gave
evidence that for some time after the surrender of the convent it had
remained empty, and that he had himself kept the keys until Cawarden
took possession of it in 1550. Cawarden then invited him to a supper
and a play in the hall.<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a> The Revels seem to have had the use of
the upper frater or parliament chamber during Henry VIII’s reign.<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a>
But the surveys of 1548 and 1550 locate them to the north of this, in
the southernmost of the four halls of the old guest-house. The two
central halls, together with the convent kitchen, had been tenanted as
far back as 1539 by successive Lords Cobham, to whose house they were
adjacent.<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> In 1554, however, Cawarden sold the two rooms to George
Lord Cobham, together with the porter’s lodge, which underlay his
original holding, and received as part of his consideration a release
from any claim which Cobham may have had to the kitchen yard and to
the property granted to Cawarden on the west side of Water Lane.<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a>
With the upper rooms transferred to Cobham went ‘appurtenances’, which
probably included the corresponding ground-floor rooms, as these are
not traceable in More’s possession and apparently formed part of the
Cobham estate when that was disposed of in the next century.<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a>
The porter’s lodge was all on the ground floor. It had a frontage of
21 ft. on the cloister and ran back for 47 ft. towards Water Lane.
At the time of Cawarden’s grant in 1550 it had been occupied by John
Barnard, clerk comptroller of the Tents and Revels, but he had died in
the same year.<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> Naturally it was convenient for the officers of
the Revels to live in the Blackfriars. John Holt, the yeoman, had a
house to the north of the churchyard. Thomas Philipps, the clerk, had
the ‘little chamber’ west of the frater. The paved hall served him as
a wood store, and from time to time some of Cawarden’s servants lay
there. About 1552 Cawarden moved Philipps to the Ankerhouse, and put
into the little chamber the deputy clerk, Thomas Blagrave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[493]</span> who found
it too small, and rented an adjoining chamber from Cheyne.<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> The
paved hall was then let, with other neighbouring rooms on more than
one floor, to one Woodman, who kept an ordinary in the hall and did a
good deal of damage to the property.<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a> Meanwhile, the Revels had
apparently been moved from this first-floor hall where they lay in
1550, for when this hall is recited as the south boundary of Cobham’s
purchase in 1554, it is described as a house in the tenure of Sir John
Cheke or his assigns.<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> So long as the Tents and Revels continued
to be housed in Crown property, the offices had of course nothing
to pay for rent. But after 1550 Cawarden, as naturally, claimed an
allowance for rent, and in 1555 he was permitted to charge six years’
arrears from Michaelmas 1549 at the rate of £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
a year each for the official residences of the comptroller, clerk,
and yeoman, £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for his own, £6 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> for the office of the tents, and £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
for the ‘store and woorke howses of the revelles’. In the accounts
for 1555–9 similar charges recur annually, but the allowance for
Cawarden’s own house is raised to £10 and that for the houses of the
other officers to £5 each; and the £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the
Revels office is specified as being ‘for the rente of fyve greate
roomes within the Blackefryers for the woorke and store howses of the
Revelles’.<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> About 1560 the store-house was certainly not the hall
over the buttery, but the great vaulted room in the south-west corner
of the cloister, which had been the lavabo of the friars.<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a> On the
other hand, Sir John Cheke’s tenure of his house had ceased and the
vacated rooms had become available for workhouses. This is evident
from the terms of a lease of the same rooms to Sir Henry Neville,
executed on 10 June 1560, just after the Revels had been removed to
St. John’s.<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> Cawarden had died on the previous 29 August, and the
lease was one of the first dealings of William More with the property.
The principal rooms leased were precisely four in number. They had
been ‘lately called or knowen by the name of Mr. Chekes lodginge and
sythence vsed by Sir Thomas Cawarden knight deceased for the office
of the Quenes Maiesties Revelles’. They were bounded on the north by
Lord Cobham’s house, on the east by the houses of More and of Sir
Henry Jerningham, who was Lady Kingston’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[494]</span> son and heir, and on the
west by another house of More’s in the occupation of Richard Frith,
and by the way leading to More’s house and garden and a piece of void
ground. Under them and leased with them were the buttery and pantry;
and the lease also covered a cellar and a ‘greate rome in manner of a
grete seller having a chimpney’ which I suppose to have been the late
Revels store-house. The upstairs rooms were approximately 157 ft. long,
27 ft. wide at the north end, and 22 ft. wide at the south end.<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a>
The length agrees approximately with the sum of the lengths of the
upper frater and of the hall over the buttery not included in Cobham’s
purchase of 1554; and it was evidently from these that Neville’s
holding was taken. But the head of the staircase must have interfered
with his width in the middle, and it will be observed that, while he
had the full width of the northern block, he had less than half the
full width (52 ft.) of the frater. Evidently Cawarden had partitioned
the frater to make it ‘mansionable’, and in particular had divided it
into two tenements by a partition from north to south. Neville’s was
the eastern division. The western division and the rooms at the top of
the staircase tower were in the tenure of Richard Frith, who had taken
a twenty-four years’ lease from Cawarden in April 1555 and had obtained
a renewal from More on 24 December 1559. Here, in 1561, Frith kept a
dancing-school.<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> Neville’s lease also gave him a share in More’s
water-supply, a strip of the void ground, formerly the convent kitchen
yard, between the northern block and Water Lane, and a right of way
to the buttery and pantry through the rest of that ground, which was
reserved to More. Neville’s strip lay just south of Cobham’s garden
wall. That reserved by More was partly taken up by ways to his garden
and gate-house entries. In the space between these was erected in 1561
a public conduit, which received the water-supply after it left More’s
tap, and passed it on to the Earl of Pembroke’s house at Baynard’s
Castle. Here also stood a tennis ground, tenanted with a cellar under
the northern block by Frith.<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> The gate-house entry, or at least
the way to it, served Frith’s house, as well as More’s own. Near it
were certain rooms, reserved for More’s use or that of his servant John
Horley, which may have been constructed out of the ‘blind’ parlour.
The great stairs in the tower between the two blocks were probably
assigned to Frith. They were not included in Neville’s lease, and he
was specifically debarred from any right of access through More’s
house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[495]</span> or garden except by More’s licence. It was probably contemplated
that he would build stairs to the upper floor for himself, and this is
perhaps why More exacted no fine on the execution of the lease.<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a>
At any rate Neville did build stairs on the west of the house, placing
them not in his own strip of yard but in More’s, with his water-cock in
a little room at the stair foot. The pale of Frith’s tennis court was
altered to allow of access between it and Neville’s stairs from More’s
garden entry to his gate-house entry.<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> In his own strip Neville
built a kitchen and another set of stairs behind it which must have led
into the extreme north end of his house, as the site of the kitchen
underlay, not Neville’s own rooms, but those purchased by Cobham in
1554. The rest of the strip served as a woodyard, and had a privy
in it. Presumably the original convent kitchen acquired by Cawarden
had been pulled down. Within the house Neville put up partitions,
turning his four rooms into six, of which it may be inferred that
two lay in the northern block and four in the southern, and adorning
one of these latter with wainscoting most of the way round, and with
a great round portal.<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a> About Lady Day 1568 More bought back
the lease from Neville for £100, doubtless in consideration of the
improvements.<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> For a time it seems to have been occupied by the
Silk Dyers Company.<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> On 6 February 1571 it was let to William Lord
Cobham, the terms of whose lease closely resemble those of Neville’s,
but record the changes made during his predecessor’s tenancy.<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a>
Cobham gave up the house in 1576, and on 27 August of that year Neville
wrote to More to recommend a new applicant for the tenancy, his friend
Richard Farrant. With it came an application from Farrant himself.
Apparently his tenancy entailed the removal of an Italian, who may have
been one of the silk dyers, and he desired to be allowed to take down
one of the partitions. On 17 September he wrote to ask that a small
room, 6 ft. by 4½ ft., occupied by More’s man Bradshaw might be added
to his holding.<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a> His lease was executed on 20 December.<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a> It
gives him all the rooms which Neville had had, with the exception of
the former Revels store-house, which is now described as ‘that great
rome nowe vsed for a wasshynge howse’; and it adds the little room
specially asked for, which had been contrived by throwing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[496]</span> together a
privy and a coal-house. Richard Farrant was Master of the Children of
Windsor Chapel, and deputy to William Hunnis as Master of the Children
of the Chapel Royal, and his object in taking the house was to have a
room in which the children could give public representations for profit
of the plays which they were afterwards to perform at Court. He carried
out his plan, and so the old frater of the friars, once the parliament
chamber of the realm, became the first Blackfriars theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a></p>

<p>More, according to his own account, was not best pleased at the use
made of his house. He complained that Farrant, after pretending that
he only meant to teach the children in it, had made it a ‘continuall
howse for plays’ to the offence of the precinct, and to fit it for
the purpose had pulled down and defaced Neville’s partitions, spoiled
the windows, and brought the house to great ruin. He had also sublet
certain portions, and, as he was not entitled to do this under his
lease without licence, More claimed the forfeiture of the lease. At
this moment, on 30 November 1580, Farrant died, leaving the house to
his widow Anne. For some months there were no plays in the theatre.
Then Hunnis resolved to carry on Farrant’s enterprise himself, and on
a recommendation from the Earl of Leicester More appears to have given
at least a tacit consent to a sub-letting by Anne to Hunnis and one
John Newman on 20 December 1581. They were to do repairs and pay her
£6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> in rent more than the £14 due to More. An
unfortunate slip of the scrivener’s pen cut Mrs. Farrant’s profit down
to £6 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> They also gave bonds of £100 each for the
due fulfilment of their covenants, and according to Newman’s statement
to More, paid £30 down. According to Mrs. Farrant they neglected their
repairs and were extremely irregular with their rent, so that she was
put to great shifts in order to satisfy Sir William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[497]</span> More, disposing of
a small reversion given her by the Queen, pawning her plate and jewels,
selling a dozen of gold buttons here and a set of viols there, and
borrowing of powerful friends such as Lord Cobham or Henry Sackford,
the Master of the Tents. Meanwhile Hunnis and Newman disposed of
their interest to one Henry Evans, a scrivener, and More, incensed at
this, took definite steps in the spring of 1583 to recover his house
by executing a fresh lease to one of his men, Thomas Smallpiece, and
setting Smallpiece to sue for the ejectment of Evans. The latter tried
to elude him by a further transfer of the sub-lease to the Earl of
Oxford, who passed it on to John Lyly, the poet; and thus, says More,
the title was ‘posted over from one to another from me’ contrary to the
conditions of the original lease. Doubtless Hunnis, Lyly, and Evans
were all working together under the Earl’s patronage, for a company
under Oxford’s name was taken to Court by Lyly in the winter of 1583–4
and by Evans in the winter of 1584–5, and it seems pretty clear that
in 1583–4, at any rate, it was in fact made up of boys from the Chapel
and Paul’s.<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a> More, however, pursued his point, and about Easter
1584 recovered legal possession of his house. Some months before,
Anne Farrant, in despair, had appealed to Sir Francis Walsingham, and
had also brought actions at common law against Hunnis and Newman for
the forfeiture of their bonds. They applied to the Court of Requests
to take over the case, and there is no formal record of the outcome.
But in January 1587 Mrs. Farrant was again complaining to the Privy
Council, and Sir John Wolley was asked to bring about a settlement
between her and More, who was his father-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a></p>

<p>So ends the story of the first Blackfriars theatre. The premises which
it had occupied came into the hands of Henry Lord Hunsdon, who was also
about the same time tenant of More’s mansion house and garden.<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a>
It would seem that Lord Oxford and Lyly had passed on to Hunsdon their
sub-leases from the Farrants and that, even when he recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[498]</span> legal
possession from the court, More did not care to interfere with this
arrangement. But there was evidently some friction. The sub-leases were
due to expire in 1590 or 1591, and in April 1586 More refused to renew
them. His excuse was that ‘The howses yow had of Lyllye I determyne
that assone as theye bothe shall cum into my handes to kepe them to the
onelye vse of me and mye chylderne’. In acknowledging this decision,
Hunsdon complained that the pipe of water belonging to one of the
houses had been diverted to serve that of Lord Cobham. In 1590 he made
a fresh attempt to secure a renewal. More at first drafted a letter of
consent, but then changed his mind and told Hunsdon that he needed the
houses for his daughter Lady Wolley and for himself on his visits to
London. Hunsdon had suffered annoyance because the tenant of the next
house ‘having the vse of the leades, either by negligence or otherwise,
suffereth the boyes to cutt upp the lead with knifes or to boore yt
through with bodkyns wherby the rayne cometh throwghe’.<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a> This
allusion, together with that to the pipe of water, makes it clear that
Hunsdon’s houses included the rooms covered by Neville’s lease of 1560,
in which the right of dancing-master Frith to use the leads over the
southern block is expressly safeguarded. I think it is probable that
the two houses are merely the southern and northern sections of the
Farrant holding, separately sublet to Hunsdon. It is known that Farrant
himself, while in occupation of the theatre, had let off certain rooms.
More’s wish to retain the property for family reasons did not long
outlast its immediate purpose of decently covering a refusal to the
Lord Chamberlain. Frith’s tenancy also came to an end, and for some
period between 1590 and 1596 the rooms formerly constituting the upper
frater were reunited in the occupation of William de Laune, a doctor
of physic. The rooms to the north of them, after his appointment as
Chamberlain of the Exchequer on 23 November 1591, were used by More for
the purposes of the Pipe Office.<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a> The buttery and pantry beneath
were probably also relet in 1591.<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a></p>

<p>I must now turn to the history of the ‘paved hall’ and ‘blind parlour’
under the upper frater and the little chamber and kitchen to the west
of these, all of which, when Cawarden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[499]</span> obtained possession in 1550,
were under the shadow of a claim by Sir Thomas Cheyne. Blagrave’s
occupation of the little chamber terminated when the Revels Office
moved to St. John’s in 1560, and on 10 December 1564 More drafted a
lease of it to one Laurence Bywater, who had in fact been in occupation
since 1560.<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a> It is described as consisting of a hall, a chamber
above, a little room below, a kitchen, a yard, ‘a long entrie coming
in ouer the yard bourded and railed’, and a vault or cellar. The
paved hall had been let by 1572 to William Joyner, who used it as a
fencing-school. In this year Cheyne’s claim was renewed by one Henry
Pole and his wife Margaret, who was the widow of Cheyne’s eldest son.
The rooms chiefly in dispute were the paved hall and Bywater’s house,
but the Poles seem also to have claimed rooms in the tenures of Richard
Frith and Thomas Hale.<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a> It may be conjectured that these were the
rooms constructed out of the blind parlour. On the other hand More
made a counter-claim, probably not very serious, to Pole tenements in
the occupation of Christopher Fenton, Thomas Austen, and John Lewes.
Incidentally, it appears that Cawarden had not succeeded in removing
all signs of papistry from the Blackfriars, for Bywater’s house is
throughout described in the interrogatories taken as the little house
having chalices and singing cakes painted in the window. The matter
was referred to arbitration.<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> Pole’s case rested entirely on the
question of fact as to what the holding of Cheyne and his predecessors
actually comprised in 1540, since the grant named no boundaries but
merely gave Cheyne the houses and lands then in his own occupation and
formerly in those of Jasper Fylole and of Thomas Ferebye and William
Lylgrave. Pole produced some witnesses who declared that before the
surrender by the friars one Purpointe had dwelt in Bywater’s house and
kept a tavern in the fencing-school, and that subsequently Ferebye and
Lylgrave had occupied these premises. They could not say that Cheyne
himself had ever had possession of them, but Pole was able to cite the
order of the Court of Augmentation in 1550 allowing Cheyne rent for his
large room as a store-house for the tents. In More’s view this rent
was paid under a misunderstanding, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[500]</span> seems to have suggested
that the only houses occupied by Cheyne and his predecessors were
that afterwards occupied by Portinari and one ‘new built’ by Cheyne,
in which apparently Lord Henry Seymour was living at the time of the
suit. Moreover, he produced a number of witnesses, including Bywater,
Blagrave, Thomas Hale, groom of the Tents, Portinari himself, and
Elizabeth Baxter, widow of the former porter of the friars, who agreed
in deposing that the friars had never let these rooms, which were
essential as a breakfast room and a butler’s lodging to their daily
life, and gave a perfectly consistent account of the various uses of
them after the surrender by Cawarden, Woodman, Phillips, Blagrave, and
Bywater, which have already been indicated in this narrative. It does
not transpire that More confided to the arbitrators the suspicious
references to Cheyne’s claim in the surveys of 1548 and 1550. However
this may be, their decision was in his favour on the substantial issue.
The Poles were required to acknowledge his right to Bywater’s house and
the paved hall, as well as to the tenements of Frith and Hale. More, on
the other hand, was to abandon his claim to the tenements of Fenton,
Austen, and Lewes, and by way of compromise was to execute a lease of
Bywater’s house to the Poles at a nominal rent for fifty years or the
term of their lives. This he accordingly did. Nothing more is heard
of any of the premises involved until July 1584, just after More had
succeeded in putting an end to Lyly’s theatrical enterprise. By this
date both Bywater and Joyner had gone, and their places had been taken
by another fencing-master, an Italian, Rocco Bonetti by name.<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a>
Bonetti had acquired from Margaret Pole, now a widow, her life-interest
in the butler’s lodging. He had also taken over from Lyly two leases,
one of the fencing-school, the other of a house, the property of
More, immediately west of the butler’s lodging.<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a> The latter he
had repaired at some cost. He had even been rash enough to put up
additional buildings on More’s land. And he had not paid his workmen,
to whom he owed £200. The butler’s lodging is described as being in
great decay. But this also, or its site, he appears to have enlarged,
at the expense of his neighbouring tenement on the west. He feared the
expiration of his interests, and got his friends, of whom were Lord
Willoughby, Sir John North, and Sir Walter Raleigh, to approach More
for an extension of tenure. As regards the western house, More seems to
have consented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[501]</span> after much reluctance in view of Bonetti’s indebted
condition, to a lease for seven years in 1586.<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a> As regards the
butler’s lodging, he was mainly interested in the reversion after Mrs.
Pole’s death, and of this reversion he granted Bonetti a ten years’
term by a lease of 20 March 1585.<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a> The holding is described in
much the same terms as those used in Bywater’s lease of 1564. The
measurements, however, are also given. The length from north to south
was 25 ft. 2 in., and the width from east to west 22 ft. 6 in. But 4
ft. 6 in. of the length and 2 ft. of the width were not covered by Mrs.
Pole’s lease, and were taken, probably by an encroachment which the
lease was intended to regularize, from More’s tenement to the west.
For the sake of greater accuracy, the measurements and boundaries of
this western tenement are given. It was 33 ft. from north to south and
39 ft. 8 in. from east to west. It was bounded on the north by More’s
yard, on the south and west by a house of Mrs. Pole’s, on the south by
the way to Sir George Carey’s house, and on the east by More’s house in
Bonetti’s tenure, that is to say the house which is the subject of the
lease.<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a></p>

<p>Sir George Carey was the eldest son of Lord Hunsdon, and himself
became Lord Hunsdon on 22 July 1596.<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a> He is not traceable in the
Blackfriars before 1585, but continued to reside there until his death
in 1603. The way to his house corresponds in position with the way to
Lady Kingston’s house of the 1548 survey, and he had pretty clearly
acquired some or all of her property, including the infirmary under
the upper frater.<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> The way must have followed a line from Water
Lane, much the same as that of the present Printing House Lane. The
fencing-school was accessible from it by a door next to Carey’s.<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a>
Certain other data of the early surveys are a little difficult to
reconcile with those of the later documents. The surveys indicate three
parallel rows of buildings, of a comparatively insignificant character,
extending over a space roughly 80 ft. square between the frater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[502]</span> block
and Water Lane. The north row consisted of the two-storied Duchy
Chamber, a narrow building 50 ft. by 17 ft., and the parlour of Sir
John Portinari’s house. These had a frontage on the kitchen yard.
South of them came the rest of Portinari’s house, and south of this
the little chamber, 26 ft. long by 10 ft. wide, the little kitchen, 23
ft. long by 22 ft. wide, and an entry to the latter, 30 ft. long by
17 ft. wide, which I suppose to have debouched upon Water Lane. The
little chamber and kitchen had their frontage on the way leading to
Lady Kingston’s. The house referred to as Cheyne’s in the 1550 survey
is probably that occupied by Portinari. But Cheyne must also have had
other property in the same neighbourhood, which the surveys do not
mention. There was the house, probably that described as ‘new built’ in
1572, which he occupied himself, and which afterwards passed to Lord
Henry Seymour.<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> And there were the three tenements which More
claimed, but did not secure in 1572. These premises were leased as a
whole by the Poles to Christopher Fenton on 31 May 1571, and appear to
have been gradually cut up into smaller holdings. By 1610 there were
four tenants and by 1614 five. They bounded More’s property, and must
have lain in the angle of Water Lane and the way to Lady Kingston’s,
just south of the entry to the little kitchen.<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a></p>

<p>The little chamber of 1548 is undoubtedly the butler’s lodging leased
to Bywater in 1564 and to Bonetti in 1585, which was a subject of the
lawsuit in 1572. But whereas it measured 26 ft. by 10 ft. in 1548, it
measured 22 ft. 6 in. by 25 ft. 2 in. in 1585, and the enumeration of
rooms in the two leases show that, although Bonetti may have built a
small additional room upon a bit of land filched from More, there had
been no substantial change since 1564. Further, while in 1548 it was
bounded on the north by Portinari’s holding, it was reached in 1564 by
a railed and boarded entry across its yard, and documents of 1596 and
1601 make it clear that this entry terminated in a small porch opening
on the kitchen yard.<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> Similarly the little kitchen, 23 ft. by 22
ft., of 1548 had been replaced in 1584 by a house 33 ft. by 39 ft. 8
in., and of this also Portinari’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[503]</span> house had ceased to be the boundary,
and a yard of More’s had been substituted. Finally, More’s successor,
Sir George More, was in a position in 1603 to sell to one John Tice a
strip of land bounded by Tice’s house on the south, Water Lane on the
west, and the kitchen yard on the north and east, which must have been
just about where Portinari’s parlour stood at the time of the 1548
survey.<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a> I am now approaching the region of conjecture, but there
is only one way of accounting for the facts. More must have acquired
and pulled down Portinari’s house, and thus not only let light and
air into the somewhat congested district west of the frater, but also
left room for extensions in the rear of the little houses fronting on
the way to Lady Kingston’s. The extension of the little chamber he had
probably himself undertaken before 1564. It did not interfere with the
chalices and singing cakes in the window, or prevent the house from
being in decay in 1585. In 1572 it could be seen that the house had
been covered with lead, but presumably was so no longer.<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> The
extension of the little kitchen seems to have been an enterprise of
Bonetti, of which More reaped the profits. The rest of the space gained
was utilized for the fencing-school kitchen, for a staircase behind the
Duchy Chamber, and for certain yards, all of which were in existence in
1596.<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a> It is just possible that More also pulled down the west end
of the Duchy Chamber.</p>

<p>By 1596 both the fencing-school and the butler’s lodging had passed
from the occupation of Bonetti. One Thomas Bruskett had the former and
one John Favour the latter. This is the year of James Burbadge’s great
enterprise of the second Blackfriars theatre. Our first intimation of
it is from Lord Hunsdon, in a letter to More of 9 January 1596.<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a>
He has heard that More has parted with part of his house for a
play-house, and makes an offer for ‘your other howse, which once I had
also’. The deed of sale by More to James Burbadge is dated 4 February
1596.<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a> The purchase money was £600. The rooms transferred are
carefully described, but only a few of the measurements and boundaries
are given. There were seven great upper rooms, ‘sometyme being one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[504]</span>
greate and entire room’, enclosed with great stone walls, and reached
by a great pair of winding stairs from the great yard next the Pipe
Office. Other stone stairs reached leads above. These rooms had been
lately in the tenure of William de Laune, doctor of physic. Beneath
them, or beneath an entry between them and the Pipe Office, lay a
vault, of which Burbadge was to have the use only, by a ‘stoole and
tonnell’ contrived in the thickness of his north wall.<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a> Under some
part of De Laune’s seven rooms, and included in the sale, lay also
rooms 52 ft. long and 37 ft. wide, known as the ‘midle romes’ or ‘midle
stories’. These extended south to Sir George Carey’s house, and were
reached from a lane leading thereto, by a door next to Carey’s gate.
They had been in the tenure of Rocco Bonetti and were now in that of
Thomas Bruskett, together with a kitchen adjoining, and two cellars
reached by stairs from the kitchen, and lying under the north end of
the middle rooms. Bruskett had one of these, and the other was occupied
by John Favor, who dwelt in the house held for the term of her life by
Mrs. Pole. This house did not go to Burbadge, but he had one of two
small yards of which Favor had the other, between Mrs. Pole’s house and
the cellars. This yard was occupied by Peter Johnson, and Burbadge also
took four rooms tenanted by Johnson, and surrounded by his yard on the
south, Mrs. Pole’s entry on the west, and the great yard next the Pipe
Office on the north. Two of these were under De Laune’s late rooms. The
other two were under rooms, to the west of the north end of De Laune’s,
which were occupied by Charles Bradshaw, possibly the Bradshaw whose
room was begged by Farrant in 1576. Bradshaw also occupied a little
buttery, an entry and passage from the seven rooms, and a little room
for wood and coals. This lay over the buttery, on the west side of a
staircase leading to two rooms or lofts, one of which was over the east
and north of Bradshaw’s rooms and the other over the entry between the
seven rooms and the Pipe Office. These were in the occupation of Edward
Merry, who also had a room or garret over them reached by a further
staircase. A staircase also led from Peter Johnson’s yard to Bradshaw’s
rooms. Both Bradshaw’s and Merry’s rooms were included in Burbadge’s
purchase, which was completed by a small yard and privy on the north
side of Pipe Office yard, east of Water Lane, south of Cobham’s house,
and west of a house of More’s also occupied by Cobham. Burbadge was
also to have the right of depositing coal and other goods <span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[505]</span>for a
reasonable time in the old kitchen yard, now called ‘the greate yarde
next the Pipe Office’, provided he did not interfere with access to the
Pipe Office itself, or to More’s garden or other parts of his premises.
The description seems complicated, as one reads the deed, but I think
that the disposition of the rooms is fairly intelligible.<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a> The
seven upper rooms, once a single great room, can only represent the
whole of the old parliament chamber or upper frater, formerly divided
into two distinct holdings. This, as we know, abutted across the
staircase upon the hall in the northern block which had formed part of
Farrant’s holding and which More had converted into the Pipe Office
in 1591.<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a> The middle rooms, together with the two easternmost of
Johnson’s rooms, must together represent the space of the paved hall
and blind parlour. There is no reason to suppose that Burbadge bought
from More, or that More ever possessed, anything beyond this space
on the ground floor of the frater block; and if the hall and parlour
were, as I have suggested, of equal size, the total space passing to
Burbadge on this floor was 74 ft. from north to south and 52 ft. from
east to west. The rest of the floor had been Lady Kingston’s and passed
to Sir George Carey.<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a> Johnson’s other two rooms and Bradshaw’s
rooms above them, lying to the west of the north end of the seven great
rooms, must be the two floors of the Duchy Chamber. The yards behind
them were rendered possible by the clearance of Portinari’s house.
Bradshaw’s two smaller rooms were on the staircase tower, and Merry’s
rooms and garret were partly at the top of this staircase and partly
above the Duchy Chamber.</p>

<p>The property purchased by Burbadge was extended at various dates after
his death in February 1597 by his sons Cuthbert and Richard. On 26 June
1601 they bought for £95 from Sir George More the reversion of the
butler’s lodging, subject to the life-interest of Mrs. Pole and to the
ten years’ lease after her death, which had in the interval since 1585
passed from Rocco Bonetti to Thomas Bruskett.<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a> On 30 May 1610 they
purchased two-thirds of the interests of the heirs of Mrs. Pole and of
a mortgagee in the houses formerly held by Christopher Fenton, and on
7 July 1614 also purchased the remaining interest. These houses cost
them in all £170.<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a> If, as is not unlikely, they also purchased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[506]</span>
at some time the house which in 1585 stood on the site of the little
kitchen of 1548, and the bit of land sold to John Tice in 1603, the
whole of the plot between the frater on the east, Water Lane on the
west, the kitchen yard on the north, and the way to Lord Hunsdon’s
house on the south, will have passed into their hands. There is no
indication that they ever acquired any part of Lord Hunsdon’s house.
This was apparently occupied by the French ambassador in 1623, when
one of its upper rooms, used as a chapel, fell, and many persons were
killed. Camden in his notes for Jacobean annals confused this room with
the theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a> About 1629 the King’s printers, Robert Barker and
John Bill, secured Hunsdon House for their press, and it remained the
King’s printing house until the Great Fire.<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a> On 19 December 1612
the Burbadges obtained from the Cobham estate a piece of land for the
enlargement of the yard near the Pipe Office, which was serving twenty
years later to turn coaches in.<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a></p>

<p>To make an end for the present of topography, the fortunes of the
property to the north of the Burbadge purchases may be briefly traced.
Sir William More died in 1601 and his son and successor, Sir George,
had no need for a Pipe Office. The rooms were therefore leased,
with others, on 23 April 1601 to Sir Jerome Bowes at a rent of £14
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> ‘and certein glasses’.<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> I think that the
other rooms included the old lavatory of the friars, once a Revels
store-house and thereafter a wash-house for More’s mansion, and that it
was in this room that Bowes established the glass-house which became an
important industry of the Blackfriars.<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a> On 19 June 1609 Sir George
More sold this property, subject to Bowes’s lease, together with the
mansion house, the great garden and all that remained to him within
the great cloister, to a syndicate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[507]</span> whose members in 1611 divided the
purchase amongst themselves.<a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a> The former Pipe Office, now called
the gate-house, with its yard, part of the glass-house, and a strip of
the garden 23 ft. 10 in. wide passed to William Banister. Banister’s
son Thomas sold them in 1616 to Gideon De Laune and De Laune in 1617
to Jacob Hardratt. Then Hardratt rebuilt the property and in 1619 sold
back to De Laune a tenement which extended 43 ft. from north to south,
and 24 ft. westwards from ‘the great gate near the play-house’ to the
tenement occupied by a widow Basil. It had a small garden on the east,
lying south of another garden belonging to De Laune.<a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a> The length
of 43 ft. exceeds by 6 ft., the width of an entry, that of the Pipe
Office rooms, the site of which De Laune’s tenement no doubt occupied.</p>

<p>The big sale of 1609 did not include the kitchen and kitchen stairs
built by Sir Henry Neville about 1560, or the wood yard which enclosed
them. A bit of this yard had been included in Burbadge’s purchase of
1596. The rest of the property, with the water supply, had been bought
on 11 March 1601, by Henry Lord Cobham, whose house it underlay.<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a>
It had in fact been held by his father as far back as 1596.<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a> In
1603 Cobham was attainted. His Blackfriars property was forfeited to
the Crown, but regranted to his widow, Lady Kildare, and for some
years remained in the hands of trustees for her and her daughter Lady
Howard.<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a> In 1612 an additional bit of the wood yard was sold,
as already stated, to the Burbadges. Finally, in 1632 the estate was
conveyed to the Company of Apothecaries, in whose hands it has since
remained.<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a> They must also have acquired the house of Gideon De
Laune, who was one of their founders, and therefore their present
premises, in their extent of 116 ft. from north to south, exactly
replace the ‘northern block’ of buildings which stood to the west of
the main Blackfriars cloister, when Sir Thomas Cawarden took possession
of it in 1550.</p>

<p>James Burbadge was not destined to see the success of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[508]</span> his adventure.
After all, he was prevented from establishing his theatre in 1596.
Play-houses had just been suppressed in the City, and a number of the
more important inhabitants of the Blackfriars disliked the idea of one
being opened in their select residential precinct, where no common
play-house had yet been seen. Farrant’s theatre, nominally intended
for the private practice of the Chapel boys, was presumably regarded
as not falling within the category of common play-houses. A petition
was sent to the Privy Council, amongst the signatories to which were
Burbadge’s neighbour, Sir George Carey, now Lord Hunsdon, Elizabeth
Lady Russell, who lived a little farther up Water Lane, and Richard
Field, the printer of Shakespeare’s poems.<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> The extant copy of
the petition is not dated, but later references assign it to November
1596, and inform us that as a result the Privy Council forbade the use
of the house.<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a> On James Burbadge’s death in February 1597 the
Blackfriars property passed to his son Richard.<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a> It is not known
what use he made of it before 1600, but in that year the resumption
of plays by the Chapel children under Nathaniel Giles gave him an
opportunity of following Farrant’s example, and letting the theatre for
what were practically public performances ‘vnder the name of a private
howse’.<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> With Giles were associated one James Robinson and Henry
Evans, who had already been concerned in the enterprise of John Lyly
and the Earl of Oxford; and it was to Evans that, on 2 September 1600,
Burbadge leased ‘the great hall or roome, with the roomes over the
same, scituate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[509]</span> within the precinct of the black Friours’, for a term
of twenty-one years from Michaelmas 1600, at a rent of £40,<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a> while
Evans and his son-in-law Alexander Hawkins gave a joint bond in £400
as collateral security for due payment. Evans set up a company, which
under various names, and throughout shifting financial managements,
maintained a substantial continuity of existence, and occupied the
Blackfriars for a period of eight years. Its fortunes are dealt with
in detail elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a> Only those points directly bearing upon
the theatre as such need now be noted. In October 1601, when Evans
was negotiating a partnership with Edward Kirkham, William Rastall,
and Thomas Kendall, he apparently undertook to transfer his lease to
Hawkins in trust to reassign a moiety of the interest under it to
these partners.<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a> No reassignment, however, was in fact made.
Evans carried out some repairs in December 1603, and trouble arose
with his partners because he severed the school-house and chamber over
the same from the great hall and used them as private apartments to
dine and sup in.<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> When the playing companies were hard hit by the
plague of 1603–4, Evans began to treat with Burbadge for a surrender
of the lease.<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a> This came to nothing at the time, but in August
1608, when the Revels company was in disgrace for playing Chapman’s
<i>Byron</i> and Kirkham had declared a desire to make an end of the
speculation, the suggestion was revived, and the surrender, probably
with the assent of Hawkins, actually took place.<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> As part of his
consideration, Evans, through a nominee, was admitted by Burbadge into
a new syndicate, of which the other members were Burbadge himself and
his brother Cuthbert, and some of the leading players of the King’s
company, by whom it was intended that the Blackfriars should now be
used.<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[510]</span> King’s men probably entered upon their occupation of
the theatre in the autumn of 1609, and thereafter used it alternatively
with the Globe, as their winter house, up to the end of their career
in 1642.<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a> The new syndicate consisted of seven partners, who may
be called ‘housekeepers’, in accordance with the terminology found in
use in 1635, in order to distinguish them from the ‘sharers’ in the
acting profits of the company.<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a> On 9 August 1608 Richard Burbadge
executed six leases, each conveying a seventh part of the play-house
for a term of twenty-one years from the previous midsummer, and
entailing the payment of a seventh part of the rent of £40. The six
lessees were his brother Cuthbert, John Heminges, William Shakespeare,
Henry Condell, William Sly, and Thomas Evans. The remaining interest
he no doubt retained himself. Sly, however, died five days later, and
his share was surrendered by his executrix, and divided amongst the
other partners. On 25 August 1611 it was transferred to William Ostler.
After his death on 16 December 1614 it should have passed to his widow,
Thomasina, but her father John Heminges retained it, and in 1629 she
estimated that he had thus defrauded her of profits at the rate of £20
a year.<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a> At some date later than 1611 John Underwood must have
been admitted to a share, for he owned one at his death in 1624. The
original leases terminated in 1629. Probably new ones were then entered
into, for by 1633 we find that the rent had been increased to £50, and
in 1635 that the interest of the housekeepers had still four years to
run, and that it was divided not into seven, but into eight parts.
Cuthbert Burbadge and the widows of Richard Burbadge and Henry Condell
still represented the original holders. Two parts had been bought in
1633 and 1634 from Heminges’s son by John Shank. One part was still
held in the name of Underwood, but a third of it was apparently in
the hands of Eillart Swanston. John Lowin and Joseph Taylor had each
a part. As a result of the dispute the Lord Chamberlain ordered a new
partition under which Shank resigned one share to be divided between
Swanston, Thomas Pollard, and Robert Benfield.<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[511]</span></p>

<p>The occupation of the Blackfriars by the King’s men was not wholly
peaceful. The beginning of their tenure almost exactly coincided with
the grant of the new charter by which the jurisdiction of the City was
extended to the precinct.<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a> It was not, however, until 1619 that
an attempt was made to invoke this jurisdiction against them. In that
year the officials of the precinct and the church of St. Anne’s, backed
up by a few of the inhabitants, sent a petition to the Corporation,
in which they recited the inconveniences due to a play-house in their
midst, recalled the action taken by the Privy Council in 1596, as well
as the Star Chamber order of 1600 limiting the London play-houses to
two, and begged that conformity to the wishes of the Council might be
enforced. The Corporation made an order for the suppression of the
Blackfriars on 21 January 1619.<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a> It clearly remained inoperative,
but explains why the King’s men thought it desirable to obtain a fresh
patent, dated on 27 March 1619, in which their right to play at ‘their
private house scituate in the precinctes of the Blackfriers’, as well
as at the Globe, was explicitly stated.<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">[1624]</a> They had to face another
attack in 1631. Their opponents on this occasion approached Laud, then
Bishop of London.<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a> After some delay Laud seems to have brought the
matter before the Privy Council. The idea was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[512]</span> mooted of buying the
players out and on 9 October 1633 a commission of Middlesex justices
was appointed to report as to the value of their interests.<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a> These
were estimated by the players at £21,990, and by the commissioners at
£2,900. The only offer towards a compensation fund was one of £100 from
the parish of St. Anne’s.<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a> Evidently the proposal was allowed to
drop. On 20 November 1633, the Privy Council made an order forbidding
coaches to stand in Ludgate or St. Paul’s Churchyard while the
performances were going on, but even this regulation was practically
cancelled by an amending order made at a meeting presided over by the
King in person on 29 December.<a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a></p>

<p>It is rather disappointing that the numerous documents bearing upon
the occupation of the Blackfriars between 1600 and 1608 should throw
so little light upon the way in which James Burbadge adapted his
purchase ‘with great charge and troble’ to the purposes of a theatre.
The lease of 1600 did not cover the whole of the property, but only a
‘great hall or roome, with the roomes over the same’. Presumably this
was the case also with the leases of 1608, since the rent was the same
as in 1600. The rest of the premises, with those purchased later by
the younger Burbadges, may be represented by the four tenements valued
at £75 a year in 1633, and the ‘piece of void ground to turn coaches’
valued at £6 was doubtless the fragment of the old kitchen yard north
of the approach. The Kirkham lawsuits tell us that one or two rooms
were reserved for the residence of Evans in 1602 and that during the
early part of 1604 ‘a certen rome, called the Scholehouse, and a certen
chamber over the same’ had been ‘seuered from the said great hall, and
made fitt by’ Evans ‘at his owne proper cost and chardges, to dyne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[513]</span> and
supp in’.<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a> Professor Wallace has a number of additional lawsuits,
still unpublished.<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a> But the extracts from these given by him in
1908 add only a few details to those formerly known. They seem to
amount to this. The hall was 66 ft. from north to south and 46 ft. from
east to west. It was paved, and had a stage, galleries, and seats of
which a schedule was attached to the lease. The stage was at one end
of the hall. The school-house was at the north end of the hall.<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a>
At this end also must have been the entrance, as one of the petitions
of 1619 locates it near the way used from part of the precinct in
going to church.<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a> It was doubtless by the gate-house entry to the
cloister, just beyond where the coaches turned. Unfortunately one is
left quite in doubt upon the critical question as to which of the rooms
known to us from earlier records were used for the theatre. It might
have been the upper frater with the partitions removed; it might have
been constructed out of the paved hall and blind parlour beneath, which
appear to be represented by the ‘midle romes’ and two of the rooms
in the occupation of Peter Johnson enumerated in the conveyance to
Burbadge. <i>A priori</i> one would have thought the upper frater the
most likely. It may very well have been paved, like the hall beneath
it, and a chamber which had held parliaments and a legatine trial
could amply suffice to hold a theatre. On this supposition the rooms
‘above’ the hall which were conveyed by the lease of 1600, and one of
which Evans converted into a dining-room can only have been the room
over the staircase and the garret over that. These, indeed, may have
extended over the north end of the frater proper, although in the main
that building appears, down to the time when Burbadge bought it, to
have had nothing over it but leads.<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a> There is a serious difficulty
in the way of the alternative theory, which would identify the theatre
with the ‘midle romes’ on the ground floor. This is that these would
most likely only be low rooms, vaulted to carry the heavy floor of the
parliament chamber above. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[514]</span> whole, the balance of probability
appears to be strongly in favour of the upper frater.</p>

<p>Professor Wallace’s account of the matter is categorical. ‘The south
section’, he says, ‘underwent a thorough transformation. The two
stories were converted into the auditorium called “the great Hall or
Room”.... The roof was changed, and rooms, probably of the usual dormer
sort, were built above the Great Hall.’<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a> I do not know whether
there is any evidence for this theory, which disregards a good many
structural difficulties, in those parts of his recently discovered
documents which Professor Wallace has not published; there is certainly
none in those which he has. If not, I do not think we must assume
that Burbadge undertook expensive building operations, when he had
all the facilities for planning an admirable auditorium without them.
Professor Wallace seems to have been led into his conjecture by an
assumed necessity for providing space for three tiers of galleries.
There is no such necessity, and in fact no evidence for more than one
tier, although I dare say that the upper frater taken by itself was
high enough for two. Professor Wallace cites a reference to ‘porticibus
<i>anglice</i> galleryes’, and points out that ‘galleryes’ is a plural.
This is so, but the ‘galleryes’ were not necessarily superimposed; if
one ran along the east side of the hall and the other along the west,
they would still constitute a plural. Professor Wallace takes the step
from his plural to three with the aid of Cockledemoy’s address to ‘my
very fine Heliconian gallants, and you, my worshipful friends in the
middle region’.<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">[1635]</a> Obviously the ‘middle region’ is not bound to be
the middle one of three galleries; it may just as well be the space
between the stage and the galleries.</p>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this inquiry to trace the detailed fortunes
of the Blackfriars during its later years. By Caroline times it took
place of the Globe as the principal and most profitable house of
the King’s men.<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a> In 1653, when like the rest of the theatres
it was closed, Richard Flecknoe recalled its origin and wrote its
epitaph.<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[1637]</a> It was pulled down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[515]</span> 6 August 1655.<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a> This site
was used for tenements, which in course of time were replaced by <i>The
Times</i> office which now occupies the site.<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[1639]</a></p>


<h5>ii. THE WHITEFRIARS</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The relevant dissertations are
P. Cunningham, <i>The Whitefriars, the Salisbury Court, and
the Duke’s Theatres</i> (1849, <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>, iv.
89), J. Greenstreet, <i>The Whitefriars Theatre in the Time of
Shakspere</i> (1888, <i>N. S. S. Trans.</i> 269), with text
of the Bill and Answer in the Chancery suit of <i>Androwes v.
Slater</i> (1609), and A. W. Clapham, <i>The Topography of the
Carmelite Priory of London</i> (1910, <i>Brit. Arch. Assoc.
Journal</i>, n. s. xvi. 15), with seventeenth-century plan of
the precinct, reproduced by Adams, 312.]</p>
</div>

<p>The only suggestion of a sixteenth-century play-house in the
Whitefriars is to be found in the statement of Richard Rawlidge in
1628 that one was suppressed there at a date under Elizabeth which he
does not specify, but which may most plausibly be put at 1596 (cf. p.
359). It is not improbable that Rawlidge wrote ‘Whitefriars’ when he
should have written ‘Blackfriars’, but Malone (<i>Var.</i> iii. 46,
52) accepted the statement and assigned the suppression to 1580. I do
not suppose that Collier had any other basis than this for the ‘more
then 30 yeares’ of the following description which he alleged to be an
extract from ‘an original survey of some part of the precinct, made
in March 1616’ in his possession, and printed in his <i>New Facts</i>
(1835), 44:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The Theater is situate near vnto the Bishopps House, and was
in former times a hall or refectorie belonging to the dissolved
Monastery. It hath beene vsed as a place for the presentation
of playes and enterludes for more then 30 yeares, last by the
Children of her Majestie. It hath little or no furniture for a
play-house, saving an old tottered curten, some decayed benches,
and a few worne out properties and peeces of Arras for hangings
to the stage and tire house. The raine hath made its way in and
if it bee not repaired, it must soone be plucked downe or it
will fall.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[516]</span></p>

<p>The earliest record, therefore, on which reliance can be placed is
the lawsuit of <i>Androwes v. Slater</i> in 1609,<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">[1640]</a> which recites
the lease by Robert Lord Buckhurst to Michael Drayton and Thomas
Woodford for six years eight months and twenty days from March 1608 of
‘a messuage or mansion howse parcell of the late dissolved monastery
called the Whitefriars, in Fleete streete, in the subvrbs of London’,
while the articles of agreement between the sharers of the King’s
Revels syndicate (cf. ch. xii), of the same date, assign lodgings in
the house to Martin Slater, and add</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The roomes of which howse are thirteene in number, three belowe
and tenne above, that is to saie, the greate hall, the kitchin
by the yard, and a cellar, with all the roomes from the east
ende of the howse to the Master of the revells’ office, as the
same are now severed and devided.’<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[1641]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The precinct of the former priory of the Carmelites or White Friars lay
between Fleet Street and the river, to the east of Serjeants’ Inn and
to the west of Water Lane, which divided it from Salisbury Court, the
old inn of the bishops of Salisbury, which had passed to the Sackvilles
in the sixteenth century, and ultimately became known as Dorset House
(Stowe, <i>Survey</i>, ii. 45). The precinct was a liberty, and its
history, from the point of view of local government, had been closely
analogous to that of the Blackfriars. Like the Blackfriars, it came
under complete civic control in this very year of 1608 (cf. p. 480).
The Whitefriars mansion itself the Sackvilles probably acquired from
the family of Thomas Lord De La Warr, to whom a grant of priory
property was made in 1544 (Dugdale, vi. 1572).</p>

<p>From the King’s Revels the Whitefriars passed to the occupation of the
Queen’s Revels (cf. ch. xii) in 1609, and continued in their use both
before and after their amalgamation with the Lady Elizabeth’s in March
1613. It is named on the title-pages of <i>Woman a Weathercock</i>
(1612) and <i>The Insatiate Countess</i> (1613), and a reference in
the prologue to ‘daughters of Whitefriars’ shows that it was also the
locality of <i>Epicoene</i> (1609). In February 1613 it was ‘taken up’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[517]</span>
by some London apprentices for an invitation performance of Robert
Tailor’s <i>The Hog Hath Lost His Pearl</i> (q.v.). From March 1613 the
amalgamated companies had Bankside theatres available, first the Swan
and afterwards the Hope, but it is clear from the Watermen’s petition
(cf. p. 370) that, at any rate before the Hope was built, they mainly
used the Whitefriars. Daborne in a letter to Henslowe of 5 June 1613
speaks of the company ‘comming over’, presumably from the Whitefriars
to Bankside, and on 9 Dec. 1613 suggests that a play of his would be
suitable for Henslowe’s ‘publique howse’, from which it may perhaps
be inferred that Henslowe had also an interest in a ‘private’ house
at the time (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 72, 79). Apparently conversion
into a public theatre was then contemplated, for on 13 July 1613 the
Master of the Revels received a fee of £20 ‘for a license to erect a
new play-house in the White-friers, &amp;c.’ (<i>Var.</i> iii. 52). But
this scheme was stopped by the Privy Council.<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[1642]</a> On 3 June 1615
Rosseter and others obtained their patent for the Porter’s Hall theatre
in Blackfriars (cf. p. 472), which contemplated its use by the Revels,
the Prince’s, and the Lady Elizabeth’s, and incidentally recited that
the Revels Children had been trained and exercised in the Whitefriars
‘ever since’ 1610. The amalgamation was dissolved in the spring of
1616, and the Lady Elizabeth’s and the Revels probably disappeared
from London. If, therefore, the Whitefriars continued in use, it was
probably by Prince Charles’s men, who would have been left homeless by
the demolition of Porter’s Hall early in 1617. That it did continue
in use and that a renewed lease was still held by some of the parties
interested in the house in 1608 is indicated by the suit of <i>Trevell
v. Woodford</i> before the Court of Requests in 1642, from which it
appears, according to Peter Cunningham, that Sir Anthony Ashley, the
then landlord of the house, entered the theatre in 1621, and turned out
the players, on the pretence that half a year’s rent was due to him. In
1629 the Whitefriars was replaced by the Salisbury Court theatre, built
on the site of an old barn just on the other side of Water Lane.</p>

THE STRUCTURE AND CONDUCT OF THEATRES</h3>
</div>

<div class="blockquot sm">

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The only Restoration treatises
which throw any light on the pre-Restoration theatre are R.
Flecknoe, <i>A Short Discourse of the English Stage</i> (1664),
and J. Wright, <i>Historia Histrionica</i> (1699), extracts from
which are in Appendix I.</p>

<p>Archaeological material was brought together by E. Malone in
<i>Variorum</i> iii. 51, and J. P. Collier in <i>H. E. D. P.</i>
iii. 140.</p>

<p>Modern investigation may be said to begin with the discovery of
the Swan drawing in 1888. The principal dissertations up to 1916
are:</p>

<p>It remains to give some account of the iconographical material
available. Of four representations of the interiors of
play-houses, the only one of early date (<i>c.</i> 1596) is
(<i>a</i>) Arend van Buchell’s copy of a drawing by Johannes
de Witt of the Swan, published in 1888 by Gaedertz and in
more accurate facsimile by Wheatley (<i>vide supra</i>). The
other three are Caroline. (<i>b</i>) A small engraving in a
compartment of the title-page of W. Alabaster, <i>Roxana</i>
(1632), may be taken as representing a type of academic
stage, as the play was at Trinity, Cambridge, <i>c.</i> 1592.
(<i>c</i>) A very similar engraving in the title-page of N.
Richards, <i>Messallina</i> (1640), if it represents a specific
stage at all, is less likely to represent the second Fortune,
as suggested by Skemp in his edition of the play, or the Red
Bull, as suggested by Albright, 45, than Salisbury Court, where
it is clear from Murray, i. 279, that most of the career of the
Revels company, by whom it was produced, was spent. (<i>d</i>)
An engraved frontispiece to Francis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[520]</span> Kirkman’s editions (1672,
1673) of <i>The Wits, or Sport upon Sport</i> (originally
published by Marsh, 1662) has been shown by Albright, 40, to
have been erroneously regarded as a representation of the Red
Bull, to which there is an incidental reference in the preface
to Part II, and must be taken to show the type of stage on which
the ‘drolls’ contained in the book were given ‘when the publique
Theatres were shut up’.</p>

<p>A Court interlude, with performers and spectators, might be
supposed to be represented in (<i>e</i>) a woodcut prefixed to
Wilson’s <i>Three Lords and Three Ladies of London</i> (1590),
but the subject is not that of the play, and the cut is shown
by A. W. Pollard (<i>English Miracle Plays</i>, ed. 6, 1914) to
be taken from S. Batman, <i>The Travayled Pylgrime</i> (1569),
and ultimately from a fifteenth-century illustration to O. de la
Marche’s <i>Chevalier Délibéré</i>.</p>

<p>Of the exteriors of theatres there are (<i>f</i>) a small
engraving of <i>Theatrum</i> in a compartment of the title-page
of Jonson’s <i>Works</i> (1616), which may be merely a bit of
classical archaeology, but appears to have the characteristic
Elizabethan hut, and (<i>g</i>) a series of representations,
or perhaps only cartographical symbols, in the various maps
detailed in the bibliographical note to ch. xvi. Doubtfully
authentic is (<i>h</i>) a façade of the Blackfriars, reproduced
by Baker, 78, from a print in the collection of Mr. Henry
Gardiner, with a note (44) that the owner and various
antiquarians ‘believe it genuine’; and almost certainly misnamed
(<i>i</i>) a façade engraved as a relic of the second Fortune
in R. Wilkinson, <i>Londina Illustrata</i> (1819), ii. 141,
and elsewhere, which is plausibly assigned by W. J. Lawrence,
<i>Restoration Stage Nurseries</i>, in <i>Archiv</i> (1914),
301, to a post-Restoration training-school for young actors.</p>

<p>A small ground-plan (<i>k</i>) of the Swan appears upon a
manor map of Paris Garden in 1627, reproduced by W. Rendle in
Harrison, ii, App. I.</p>

<p>A rough engraving (<i>l</i>) on the title-page of <i>Cornucopia,
Pasquils Nightcap</i> (1612) shows a section of the orchestra
of a classical play-house as seen from the stage, and throws
no light on contemporary conditions; and (<i>m</i>) the design
by Inigo Jones described in ch. vii is of uncertain date, and
intended for the private Cockpit theatre at Whitehall.</p>

<p>I know of no representation of an English provincial stage,
and unfortunately E. Mentzel, who describes (<i>Gesch. der
Schauspielkunst in Frankfurt am Main</i>, 38) a woodcut of a
play, with signboards, by English actors, probably at Frankfort,
Nuremberg, or Cassel, in 1597, does not reproduce it. Some
notion of the improvised stages used by travelling companies for
out-of-door performances may be obtained from the continental
engravings reproduced by Bapst, 153, by Rigal in <i>Petit de
Julleville</i>, iii. 264, 296, and by M. B. Evans, <i>An Early
Type of Stage</i> (<i>M. P.</i> ix. 421).</p>

<p>An engraving of the Restoration stage of the Theatre Royal,
Drury Lane (built 1663), from <i>Ariane, ou Le Mariage de
Bacchus</i> (1674), and another of the same house as altered in
1696, from <i>Unhappy Kindness</i> (1697), are reproduced by
Lawrence, i. 169; ii. 140. Of the five engravings of the Duke’s
Theatre, Dorset Garden (built 1671), in E. Settle, <i>Empress
of Morocco</i> (1673), one is reproduced by Albright, 47, and
another by Lawrence, ii. 160, and Thorndike, 110.</p>

<p>Graphic attempts to reconstruct the plan and elevation of a
typical Elizabethan stage will be found in the dissertations
cited above of Brodmeier, Wegener, Archer, Godfrey, Albright,
Corbin (1911, by G. Varian and J. Hambridge), and Forestier, and
in the picture reproduced in W. N. Hills, <i>The Shakespearian
Stage</i> (1919).</p>

<p>Various revivals have also been carried out on Elizabethan
stages, with more or less of archaeological purism, notably
in London (W. Poel, <i>Shakespeare in the Theatre</i>), Paris
(<i>Sh.-Jahrbuch</i>, xxxv. 383), Harvard (G. P. Baker in
<i>Sh.-Jahrbuch</i>, xli. 296), and Munich (<i>Sh.-Jahrbuch</i>,
xlii. 327).]</p>

<p>A history of the theatres would not be complete without some account of
their general structure and economy in the disposition of auditorium
and stage. I propose to begin with the more assured or less important
points, as a clearing of the way for the difficult and controverted
problems of scenic setting, on some of which I am afraid that no very
secure conclusion can be reached.</p>

<p>It is necessary, in the forefront, to appreciate the distinction
between the ‘common’ or ‘public’ play-houses and the ‘private’ houses,
which, so far as our period is concerned, were Paul’s, the Blackfriars,
and the Whitefriars. This distinction is in its origin somewhat a
technical one, for there is no reason to suppose that in the private
houses the performances were private, in the sense that access to them
could not be obtained, on payment, by members of the general public.
Probably it is to be explained in relation to the Elizabethan system
of State control of theatres, and represents an attempt to evade the
limitations on the location and the number of play-houses which had
been established through the action, first of the civic authorities
and later of the Privy Council itself. This view receives support from
the allegations made during the campaign for the suppression of the
Blackfriars in 1619 that the owner ‘doth vnder the name of a private
howse (respectinge indeed private comoditie only) convert the said
howse to a publique play-house’.<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a></p>

<p>It can hardly be supposed, however, that Burbadge could have hoodwinked
the Privy Council merely by calling the Blackfriars a ‘private’
house, without finding any other means of differentiating it from
the ‘public’ houses, and it is quite possible that the technical
distinction, for which modern analogies could be found, consisted in
the fact that admission was paid for in advance and no money taken at
the doors.<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> Mr. Lawrence has very appropriately quoted in this
connexion the Common Council regulations of 1574, in which an exception
is made for performances ‘withowte publique or comen collection of
money of the auditorie, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[523]</span> behoulders theareof’; and though I do
not suggest that the extension of this principle to Paul’s or the
Blackfriars fell within the intention of the order, the evasion may
have been allowed, within the gates of Paul’s or in a liberty, and
for a well-conducted house attended by a well-to-do audience, to
hold.<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a> If so, it is probable that Paul’s from the beginning and
the earlier Blackfriars were in effect private houses. But the actual
terminology does not emerge before the revival of the boy companies in
1599 and 1600. For some years past the title-pages of plays had vaunted
them as ‘publikely acted’.<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a> A corresponding ‘priuately acted’
appears for Blackfriars in Jonson’s <i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> (1601) and
<i>Poetaster</i> (1602), and for Paul’s in Middleton’s <i>Blurt Master
Constable</i> (1602), while the antithesis is complete in Dekker’s
<i>Satiromastix</i> (1602), which was presented ‘publikely’ by the
Chamberlain’s and ‘priuately’ by Paul’s. Somewhat later we find Field’s
<i>Woman a Weathercock</i> (1612) acted ‘priuately’, and Chapman’s
<i>Revenge of Bussy D’Ambois</i> (1613) ‘at the priuate Play-house’ in
the Whitefriars.<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a> But by this time the distinction may be taken
for granted as well established in general use.<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">[1648]</a></p>

<p>From the point of view, however, of stage arrangements, the technical
<i>differentia</i> of a private house is less important than certain
subsidiary characteristics.<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">[1649]</a> The private houses were all in
closed buildings, were occupied by boys, and charged higher prices
than the ordinary theatres. These facts entailed variations of
structure and method, which will require attention at more than one
point. They naturally became less fundamental, but did not entirely
disappear, after the transfer of the Blackfriars to the King’s men
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[524]</span> 1609, and probably passed still further into the background after
the introduction of roofed public houses in the Caroline age.<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">[1650]</a>
The title-pages generally describe the Blackfriars, the Cockpit, and
Salisbury Court as ‘private’ houses right up to the closing of the
theatres, but the term, in so far as it connotes anything different
from ‘public’, seems to have lost what little meaning it ever had.<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">[1651]</a></p>

<p>De Witt, about 1596, describes the Theatre, Curtain, Rose, and Swan
as ‘amphiteatra’, and Hentzner in 1598 adds that they were all
‘lignea’.<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">[1652]</a> The Globe and the Hope were built later on the same
structural model. The Fortune was also of wood, but square. Of the
shape and material of the Red Bull we know nothing. Prologues and
epilogues often refer to the internal appearance of the auditorium as
presenting a ‘round’, ‘ring’, ‘circuit’, ‘circumference’, or ‘O’.<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">[1653]</a>
If we can rely upon the draughtsmanship of the London maps, the
external outline was rather that of a polygon. This evidence must not
be pressed too far, for there is probably an element of cartographic
symbolism to be reckoned with. The same house may appear in one map as
a hexagon, in another as an octagon or decagon, and the late Hollar
group differs from its predecessors in using a completely circular
form. But there is confirmation in the Paris Garden manor map of
1627, which shows the ground-plan of the Swan decagonal, and in the
statement of Mrs. Thrale that the ruins of the Globe still visible in
the eighteenth century were hexagonal without and round within. This
was of course the later Globe built in 1613, and there is some reason
for thinking that the earlier Globe may have been of rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[525]</span> different
design. The verses on the fire by which it was destroyed speak of the
stage-house ‘as round as taylers clewe’, and the early Hondius map,
while it shows the Rose as polygonal, shows the Globe as circular,
with the upper half of less diameter than the lower. This construction
reappears in the Delaram drawings, and is so peculiar that the
representation may well be realistic. There was an obvious precedent
for the amphitheatrical form in the bear and bull rings which preceded
the public theatres, and I do not know that we need go back with Ordish
to a tradition of round mediaeval play-places, Cornish or English,
or to the remains of Roman occupation. A ring is the natural form in
which the maximum number of spectators can press about an object of
interest.<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">[1654]</a></p>

<p>There is nothing to show that, for the main fabric, any material but
timber was used, until the Fortune was rebuilt of brick in 1623. Timber
is provided for in the contracts for the earlier Fortune and the Hope,
and these were modelled on the Globe and Swan. Oak was to be mainly
used for the Hope; no fir in the lower or middle stories. Burbadge’s
lawsuits show that timber was the chief object of his expenditure on
the Theatre, although some ironwork was also employed, presumably to
tie the woodwork together. The dismantled fabric of the Theatre was
used for the Globe. Henslowe used a good deal of timber for the repairs
of the Rose in 1592–3, and did the house ‘about with ealme bordes’ in
1595. There was also some brickwork, and the Fortune and Hope were
to have brick foundations, a foot above the ground. The Fortune was
to be covered with lath, lime, and hair without. Henslowe also used
plaster, and I do not see anything inconsistent with a substantially
wooden structure in De Witt’s statement that the Swan was ‘constructum
ex coaceruato lapide pyrritide ... ligneis suffultum columnis’. This
has been regarded as an error which prejudices the reliability of De
Witt’s observations, but the description is too precise to be disproved
by Hentzner’s generalized ‘lignea’, and after all the strength of the
building was naturally in the columns, and the flints and mortar&mdash;a
common form of walling in the chalk districts of England&mdash;may well have
filled up the interstices between these. De Witt adds that the columns
might deceive the shrewdest ‘ob illitum marmoreum colorem’.<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">[1655]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[526]</span></p>

<p>De Witt has also been criticized for giving the seating capacity of
the Swan as 3,000. I dare say this is merely the exaggerated round
estimate of a casual visitor, but Wheatley calculates from the drawing
that the galleries might hold 2,000, and it would not be surprising
if our rude forefathers sat a bit closer than we care to do. Moryson
speaks even more largely of theatres ‘more remarkable for the number,
and the capacity, than for the building’, and ‘capable of many
thousands’, while no less than 2,000 got into Trinity College hall for
the academic plays of 1615.<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">[1656]</a> The frame of the Fortune was 80 ft.
square without and 55 ft. square within. This allows a depth of 12½ ft.
for the galleries, and Corbin calculates a seating capacity, allowing
18 in. for a seat and 18 in. square for a standing man, of 2,138 or
2,558 at a pinch.<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">[1657]</a> We do not know that the Swan was not larger
than the Fortune, and have therefore no right to assume that De Witt
was seriously out. Wright tells us that the Globe, Fortune, and Red
Bull were ‘large’ houses; he is comparing them with the private houses
of Caroline days.<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">[1658]</a> The allusion in <i>Old Fortunatus</i> to the
‘small circumference’ of the Rose perhaps hardly indicates that it was
below the average size.</p>

<p>The Swan drawing is our one contemporary picture of the interior of
a public play-house, and it is a dangerous business to explain away
its evidence by an assumption of inaccurate observation on the part
of De Witt, merely because that evidence conflicts with subjective
interpretations of stage-directions, arrived at in the course of
the pursuit of a ‘typical’ stage. Still less can it be discredited
on the ground that it was merely made by Van Buchell on ‘hearsay
evidence’ from the instructions of De Witt.<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">[1659]</a> It is a copy, like
the accompanying description on the same piece of paper, of De Witt’s
original, which De Witt says he drew (‘adpinxi’) in order to bring
out an analogy which had struck him between the English and the Roman
theatres. It was for this reason also, no doubt, that he marked certain
features of the structure on the drawing with the names of what he
thought to be their classical prototypes. I do not, of course, suggest
that the drawing has the authority of a photographic record. De Witt is
more likely to have made it as an afterthought in his inn than during
the actual performance, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[527]</span> he may well have omitted or misrepresented
features. Certainly he can hardly have seen the trumpeter sounding
when the action had already begun. And the draughtsmanship is bad, and
may have been made worse by the copyist.<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">[1660]</a> The upper part is done,
with an attempt at perspective, as he may have seen it from a point
in the middle, or perhaps the upper, gallery somewhat to the right
of the centre; the lower part as from full face, so that the pillars
stand equidistant from the edges of the stage, as they would not have
appeared to him in perspective. His doors and the compartments of his
stage gallery are of uneven sizes.<a id="FNanchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">[1661]</a> But, with all its faults,
the drawing is the inevitable basis of any comprehensive account of
the main structural features of a play-house, and I propose, leaving
aside for the present the question of the possible hangings which it
does not show, to take its parts one by one and illustrate them from
other sources, and in particular from Henslowe’s contracts for the
construction of the Fortune in 1600 and the Hope in 1614.<a id="FNanchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">[1662]</a></p>

<p>The outline of the building is round, or slightly ovoid.<a id="FNanchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">[1663]</a> The
floor, which shows no traces of seating, is marked ‘planities siue
arena’. This is the space ordinarily known as the ‘yard’, a name which
it may fairly be taken to have inherited from the inn-yards, surrounded
by galleries and open overhead, in which, in the days before the
building of the Theatre in 1576, more or less permanent play-houses
had grown up.<a id="FNanchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">[1664]</a> Spectators in the yard always stood, and the more
unstable psychology of a standing, as compared with a seated, crowd
must always be taken into account in estimating the temperament of an
Elizabethan audience. These are the ‘groundlings’, and the poets take
their revenge for occasional scenes of turbulence in open or covert
sneers at their ‘understanding’.<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">[1665]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[528]</span></p>

<p>Well into the yard, leaving space for the groundlings on three sides of
it, projects a quadrangular stage, which is marked ‘proscaenium’.<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">[1666]</a>
The breadth is perhaps rather greater than the depth.<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a> This was
certainly the case at the Fortune, where the stage was 43 ft. wide,
and extended ‘to the middle of the yarde’, a distance of 27½ ft. The
level of the stage may be some 3 or 4 ft. above the ground. Two solid
trestles forming part of its supports are visible, but at the Fortune
it was paled in with oak, and in view of the common use of the space
below the stage to facilitate apparitions and other episodes requiring
traps, this was probably the normal arrangement.<a id="FNanchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">[1668]</a> It has been
thought that the stage of the Swan, like that of the Hope, which was
in many respects modelled upon it, may have been removable. But this
is hardly consistent with the heavy pillars which, in this respect
certainly unlike the Hope, it carries. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[529]</span> the Hope had to be
available for bear-baiting, which entailed an open arena, and there
is no evidence, and very little likelihood, that baiting ever took
place at the Swan. Like other theatres, it sometimes accommodated
gymnasts and fencers, but these would use the stage.<a id="FNanchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">[1669]</a> There are
no rails round the stage, such as we may infer the existence of at
the Globe.<a id="FNanchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">[1670]</a> The only scenic apparatus visible is a large bench,
on which a lady sits, while another stands behind her in an attitude
of surprise, at the rapid approach from an outer corner of the stage
of a man in an affected attitude, with a hat on his head and a long
staff in his hand. You might take him for Malvolio cross-gartered, were
there any chance that <i>Twelfth Night</i> could have been written when
the drawing was made, or produced at the Swan.<a id="FNanchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">[1671]</a> Probably he is
a returning traveller or a messenger bringing news. The floor of the
stage is apparently bare. Sometimes rushes were laid down, at any rate
for interior scenes.<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">[1672]</a> The Globe produced <i>Henry VIII</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[530]</span> in
1613 ‘with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and majesty, even
to the matting of the stage’.</p>

<p>Circling the yard and raised above it are three tiers of galleries,
each containing three rows of seats. Beneath the first gallery De Witt
wrote ‘orchestra’, above its seats ‘sedilia’, and between the middle
and upper galleries ‘porticus’. In the classical theatre ‘porticus’ was
the name for a covered gallery, and the classical analogy also makes
it clear that by ‘orchestra’ De Witt meant to indicate the position
occupied by the spectators of highest rank, corresponding to the seats
of Roman senators, to which the name of the obsolete dancing place
immediately in front of them had been transferred. It was not until the
Restoration that the orchestra was allocated to the music.<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">[1673]</a> The
fronts of the galleries are supported by a number of turned posts. In
the Fortune all the chief supports, presumably both in the auditorium
and on the stage, were to be square and made ‘palasterwise, with carved
proporcions called Satiers’. Internal painting was contemplated, but
was not covered by the contract. Other references to painted theatres
suggest that the Elizabethan builders were not content with bare
scaffolds, but aimed at a decorative effect.<a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">[1674]</a> Three seems to have
been the regular number of galleries. Kiechel bears witness to it for
the Theatre and Curtain in 1585; and there were three at the Fortune
and at the Hope. The lowest gallery at the Fortune was 12 ft. high,
the next 11 ft., and the uppermost 9 ft., and each of the two latter
jutted out 10 in. beyond that below. This gives a total height of 32
ft., about three-fifths of the interior width of the house. The maps,
therefore, make the buildings rather disproportionately high.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[531]</span> The
uppermost gallery has a roof, marked ‘tectum’. This in the earlier
Globe was of thatch, which caused the fire of 1613, and left the
unlucky King’s men with little but ‘wit to cover it with tiles’. I
think the Rose was also thatched; but the Fortune and Hope were tiled.
In view of the jetties, such a roof would give some protection to those
in the galleries, but the groundlings had none. Both the drawing and
the maps confirm the statement of Wright that the Globe, Fortune, and
Red Bull were ‘partly open to the weather’, and this was doubtless also
the case with their predecessors.<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">[1675]</a></p>

<p>De Witt does not indicate any internal gallery partitions, but the
Swan had these by 1614, for they were to be the model for ‘two boxes
in the lowermost storie fitt and decent for gentlemen to sitt in’,
which were to be constructed at the Hope. Similarly the Fortune was
to have ‘ffower convenient divisions for gentlemens roomes, and other
sufficient and convenient divisions for twoe pennie roomes, with
necessarie seates’. These were to be ceiled with lath and plaster. An
earlier example of the technical use of the term ‘room’ for a division
of the auditorium occurs in the draft Theatre lease of 1585, which
gave the landlord a right to sit or stand in ‘some one of the upper
romes’, if the places were not already taken up. If the clause, like
the rest of the draft, merely reproduced the covenants of the 1576
lease, the term was of long standing. Probably the divisions were of
varying sizes. There would not have been much point in cutting up the
space available for ‘two-pennie roomes’ into very small sections, but
there were also ‘priuate roomes’, which are perhaps the same as the
‘gentlemens roomes’ of the contracts.<a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">[1676]</a> If so, these were probably
to the right and left of the stage in the lowest gallery. But the whole
question of seating and prices is rather difficult, and it is further
complicated by obscurely discerned changes of fashion, which involved
the adoption of the very inconvenient custom of sitting on the stage,
and the consequent abandonment by the gentry of what was called the
lord’s room. Prices also, no doubt, tended to grow, at any rate for
the better seats; the ‘popular’ prices always remained low.<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">[1677]</a> I do
not know whether the professional actors ever contented themselves,
after their establishment in London, with merely sending round the
hat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[532]</span> or, in mediaeval phrase, making a ‘gatheryng’.<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">[1678]</a> Fixed prices
must certainly have been the rule by the time of Kiechel’s visit in
1585, for he tells us that, on the occasion of a new play, double
prices were charged. This practice helps to explain the fluctuating
receipts in Henslowe’s diary, and was still in force in the seventeenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">[1679]</a> Spenser and his friends could have their laugh at
a play for 1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> in 1579, and ten years later
Martin Marprelate could be seen for 2<i>d.</i> at the Theatre and
4<i>d.</i> at Paul’s.<a id="FNanchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">[1680]</a> Higher prices are already characteristic
of the private houses. In 1596 Lambarde informs us of a regular scale,
apparently applicable to all public entertainments. None, he says,
who ‘goe to Paris Gardein, the Bell Savage or Theatre, to beholde
beare baiting, enterludes or fence play, can account of any pleasant
spectacle unlesse they first pay one pennie at the gate, another at
the entrie of the scaffolde and the thirde for a quiet standing’.
Platter, in 1599, reports the same scale and adds a distinction, not
made by Lambarde, between standings and seats. You paid 1<i>d.</i> to
stand on the level, 1<i>d.</i> at an inner door to sit, and 1<i>d.</i>
at a third door for one of the best places with a cushion.<a id="FNanchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">[1681]</a> The
two-penny galleries or rooms long continued to be the resort of the
ordinary playgoer, if he was not satisfied to stand in the yard for a
penny.<a id="FNanchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">[1682]</a> He sat close,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[533]</span> and the insolent poets and pamphleteers
classed him with the groundlings as a ‘stinkard’.<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">[1683]</a> His domain
certainly included the top gallery, but about the other galleries I
am not sure. There are some puzzling allusions to penny galleries
and rooms, but probably, these are not distinct from the ‘two-penny’
ones, and the explanation is to be found in the practice of paying
the twopence in two instalments, one on entrance, the other at the
gallery door.<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">[1684]</a> It did not long remain possible to get one of the
best seats for the 3<i>d.</i> quoted by Platter, even if there was
not already in his time a higher charge for ‘the priuate roomes of
greater price’.<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">[1685]</a> There were both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[534]</span> sixpenny and twelve-penny rooms
by 1604.<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">[1686]</a> These may have been the same private rooms at varying
prices, according as the play was old or new. I take it that you only
got a single seat, even in a ‘private’ room, for your 6<i>d.</i>
or 12<i>d.</i>, and not the whole room. Overbury or another gives
12<i>d.</i> as the price of the ‘best room’ as late as about 1614, but
in the same year the ordinary scale of charges was greatly exceeded
throughout the house on the production of <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> at
the Hope, where a speaker in the induction says, ‘it shall be lawful
to judge his six-penny-worth, his twelve-penny-worth, so to his
eighteen-pence, two shillings, half a crown, to the value of his place,
provided always his place get not above his wit’. This must have been
a quite exceptional occasion, not merely a new play, but a new play at
a new house. Similarly, when Richard Vennar brought the gulls to his
swindle of <i>England’s Joy</i> in 1602, ‘the price at cumming in was
two shillings or eighteen-pence at least’.</p>


<p>A special compartment in one of the galleries was not the only
privilege offered to the more fashionable playgoer. He might, at one
time or another, sit ‘over the stage’ and on the stage. De Witt’s
drawing shows, at the back of the stage, a raised gallery divided into
six small boxes, in each of which one or two spectators appear to
be placed.<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">[1687]</a> It is reasonable to suppose that these are sitting
‘over the stage’.<a id="FNanchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">[1688]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[535]</span> And some or all of those ‘over the stage’
again, appear to have sat in ‘the lords room’ or ‘rooms’.<a id="FNanchor_1689" href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">[1689]</a> Of
such a room we first hear in 1592, when Henslowe, repairing the Rose,
paid 10<i>s.</i> ‘for sellynge of the Rome ouer the tyerhowsse’ and
13<i>s.</i> ‘for sellinges my lords Rome’. The entry rather suggests
that this was not so much a room for ‘lords’, as a room primarily
reserved for the particular ‘lord’, under whose patronage the actors
played; but however this may be, it was probably available by
courtesy for other persons of distinction. The practice of sitting
on the stage itself first emerges about 1596.<a id="FNanchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">[1690]</a> It was general
by the seventeenth century, and was apparently most encouraged at
the Blackfriars, where it perhaps lent itself best to the structural
character of the building.<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">[1691]</a> It was known at Paul’s, but was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[536]</span>
inconvenient on so small a stage.<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">[1692]</a> And, as it certainly originated
at the public houses, so it maintained itself there, in spite of the
grumbles of the ordinary spectators, with whose view of the action the
throng of feathered and restless gallants necessarily interfered.<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">[1693]</a>
It may have been profitable to the actors as sharers, but as actors
they resented the restriction of the space available for their
movements which it entailed.<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">[1694]</a> The prologue to Jonson’s <i>The
Devil is an Ass</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[537]</span> of 1616 contains a vigorous protest.<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">[1695]</a> But
the gallant liked to be seen as well as to see, and liked to slip in
and out of the tiring-house and hob-nob with the players. It was not
until Caroline times that the custom became intolerable.<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">[1696]</a> On the
stage stools were provided for those who did not care to sit on the
rushes, and for these they paid at least sixpence and sometimes a
shilling.<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">[1697]</a> One result of the introduction of sitting on the stage
appears to have been that the lord’s room lost its attractiveness and
consequently its status. It fell into the background, and became the
haunt of a rather disreputable class of playgoer. The lords were now
to be found either on the stage itself, or in the private rooms of
the lower gallery. Presumably the ‘grate’ to which the courtier of
Sir John Davies’ epigram relegated himself, was in the lord’s room,
perhaps fitted with a casement for scenic purposes.<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">[1698]</a> The change is
chronicled by Dekker in the passage of <i>The Gull’s Horn Book</i>, in
which the gull is instructed how to behave himself in a play-house. He
must by all means advance himself up to the throne of the stage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I meane not into the Lords roome (which is now but the
Stages Suburbs): no, those boxes, by the iniquity of custome,
conspiracy of waiting-women and Gentlemen-Ushers, that there
sweat together, and the couetousnes of Sharers, are contemptibly
thrust into the reare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[538]</span> and much new Satten is there dambd, by
being smothred to death in darknesse.’</p>
</div>

<p>I return to the guidance of De Witt. The boarding between the yard
and the lower gallery, which in the Fortune was overlaid with iron
pikes, presumably to prevent the groundlings from climbing over, shows
two apertures, to right and left of the stage, one of which is marked
‘ingressus’. From these steps lead to the lower gallery itself, and
we may infer the presence of a passage to staircases behind, by which
the upper galleries were reached. The contracts show that the Fortune,
like the Globe, and the Hope, like the Swan, were to have external
staircases.<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">[1699]</a> Perhaps this accounts for the greater diameter of the
lower part of the Globe in the London maps. Of external doors there
were only two at the Globe, which caused trouble at the time of the
fire, and two also at the Fortune, when Alleyn leased a share of it
to Henslowe in 1601. One of these would in each case have been a door
to the tiring-house, giving access to the stage and the lord’s room,
while the other served the body of the theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">[1700]</a> Those bound for
the galleries paid their pennies at the theatre door, passed through
the yard to the ‘ingressus’, and made additional payments there and
in the ‘rooms’, according to the places selected.<a id="FNanchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">[1701]</a> The custom
explains itself by the arrangement between the sharers of companies
and the housekeepers of theatres, which gave the latter a proportion
of gallery takings in lieu of rent. ‘Gatherers’, appointed by the
persons interested, collected the money, and although this was put
into a locked box, whence the modern term ‘box-office’, there were
abundant opportunities for fraud. At need, the gatherers could serve as
supernumeraries on the stage.<a id="FNanchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">[1702]</a></p>

<p>At the back of the stage, and forming a chord to an arc of the circular
structure of the play-house, runs a straight wall, pierced by two
pairs of folding doors, on which De Witt has written ‘mimorum aedes’.
Above it is the gallery or lord’s room already described. This wall
is the ‘scene’, in the primary sense; it is also the front of the
‘tire-house’,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[539]</span> or in modern phrase ‘green-room’, a necessary adjunct
of every theatre. The Theatre depositions of 1592 speak of this as
‘the attyring housse or place where the players make them readye’.
The drawing indicates nothing in the way of hangings over either wall
or doors, but in some theatres these certainly existed. Thus Peacham,
in his <i>Thalia’s Banquet</i> (1620) referring to much earlier days,
tells us that</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i5">Tarlton when his head was onely seene,</div>
        <div>The Tire-house doore and Tapistrie betweene,</div>
        <div>Set all the multitude in such a laughter,</div>
        <div>They could not hold for scarce an hour after.<a id="FNanchor_1703" href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">[1703]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The front of the tiring-house is the ‘scene’ in the Renaissance
sense, and its characteristics will be of great concern in later
chapters.<a id="FNanchor_1704" href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">[1704]</a> The Fortune tire-house was to be within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[540]</span> the frame of
the theatre, and would not, therefore, unless it projected on to the
stage, have more depth than about 12 ft. Mr. Brereton, in a careful
analysis of the drawing, suggests that the Swan tire-house may not have
extended the full width of the stage, but may have left room to come
and go on either side of its front.<a id="FNanchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">[1705]</a> If so, some projection is not
improbable, but one cannot rely much upon the hazardous interpretation
of bad draughtsmanship. The ground-plan of the Swan seems to show an
annexe at one point, and of course additional depth could easily be
obtained in this way. Moreover, there were at least three stories
available. The spectators in the lord’s room would not take up the
whole depth on the level of the middle gallery, and there must have
been a corresponding space on that of the top gallery. Henslowe ceiled
‘the rome ouer the tyerhowsse’ in 1592, and an inventory of the
Admiral’s men in 1598 includes effects ‘leaft above in the tier-house
in the cheast’. No doubt a fair amount of accommodation was needed. The
tire-house was not merely a dressing-room and a store-house. Here came
the author, to rail at the murdering of his lines, and the gallants
to gossip and patronize the players.<a id="FNanchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">[1706]</a> Here were the book-holder,
who prompted the speeches, surveyed the entrances and exits, and saw
to the readiness of the properties;<a id="FNanchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">[1707]</a> the tireman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[541]</span> who fitted the
dresses and the beards, furnished stools, and in the private theatres
took charge of the lights;<a id="FNanchor_1708" href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">[1708]</a> the stage-keeper;<a id="FNanchor_1709" href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">[1709]</a> the grooms
and ‘necessary attendants’, waiting to draw curtains, to thrust out
beds, and to carry benches and banquets on and off.<a id="FNanchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">[1710]</a> Here, too,
was the head-quarters of the music, although in the public theatres the
music was largely incidental, and was often played on, or above, or
even below the stage, as might seem most appropriate to any particular
action.<a id="FNanchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">[1711]</a> Music between the acts was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[542]</span> unknown, but we learn
from the induction to the <i>Malcontent</i> that it was ‘not received’
by the audience at the Globe in 1604.<a id="FNanchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">[1712]</a> There was also, of course,
the final ‘jig’.<a id="FNanchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">[1713]</a> For an overture, the public theatres seem to
have employed nothing beyond three soundings of a trumpet, the last
of which was the signal for the prologue to begin.<a id="FNanchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">[1714]</a> Probably
the musical element tended to increase. A special music-room perhaps
existed already at the Swan in 1611, and, if so, may have been, as it
was in the later theatres, in the upper part of the tire-house.<a id="FNanchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">[1715]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[543]</span></p>

<p>The Fortune tire-house was to have ‘convenient windowes and lightes
glazed’. Some of these may have looked into the auditorium, and have
been used for scenic purposes. But the maps show external windows here
and there in the walls, and these would be necessary to light both the
tire-house and the galleries. We have a picture of Burbadge leaning
out of an upper window to greet with abuse the disturbers of his peace
at the Theatre in 1590. The yard and the stage itself were, of course,
lit, in the absence of a roof, from above. Performances were ordinarily
by daylight; before the end of the sixteenth century the time for
beginning had been fixed at 2 o’clock.<a id="FNanchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">[1716]</a> The stage-directions point
to a frequent enough use of lamps and tapers, but always to give the
illusion of scenic darkness. Plays, however, lasted at least two hours,
sometimes half an hour or even an hour longer, and there was the jig to
follow.<a id="FNanchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">[1717]</a> It must therefore be doubtful whether, in the depth of
winter, daylight could have served quite to the end. Webster complains
that the ill-success of <i>The White Devil</i> was due to its being
given ‘in so dull a time of winter, and presented in so open and black
a theatre’. Perhaps the shorter plays were chosen for the shorter days,
or the jig was omitted. But it is also possible that some primitive
illumination, in the form of cressets, or baskets of tarred and flaring

<p>The actors themselves were not wholly without protection from the
elements. De Witt depicts two heavy classical columns, which stand
on square bases rather farther back than the middle of the stage and
a little way from each side of it. These support a pent-house roof,
which starts from the level of the eaves of the ‘tectum’ over the
top gallery, and descends in a steep slope to a level opposite to
the middle of the second gallery, where it slightly projects beyond
the supporting columns. Behind and above it rises a kind of hut,
conspicuous above the ‘tectum’ and forming a superstructure to the
tire-house. Its front has less width than that of the tire-house, and
its side is shown in clumsy perspective, which is apparently followed
round by the pent-house below it. The pent-house is the only thing
in the drawing, that can represent the ‘shadow’ or ‘heavens’, which
several allusions point to as a regular feature in the public theatres,
and which certainly existed at the Rose, the Fortune&mdash;and therefore
presumably the Globe&mdash;and the Hope.<a id="FNanchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">[1719]</a> But it must be admitted that
this sharply sloping roof, coming down low and considerably impeding
the vision of the spectators at any rate in the top gallery, does not
agree very well with the notion of a heavens dominating the stage,
elaborately decorated, and serving for the display of spectacular
effects, which were surely meant to be visible to all. It is possible
that De Witt’s halting draughtsmanship has failed him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[545]</span> the attempt
to tackle the architectural perspective from a difficult angle in an
upper gallery. My impression is that, by giving too much height to the
bottom gallery, he has got the two other galleries out of line with
the stories of the tire-house to which they correspond, and that the
lower gallery should really be on the level of the stage, the middle
gallery on that of the gallery ‘over the stage’, and the top gallery
on that of the rather obscure story above. If so, the front of this
story would have been visible, and may have contained some aperture
of which account has not yet been taken in formulating theories of
staging.<a id="FNanchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">[1720]</a> And I think that the columns were really higher and the
roof flatter than De Witt has drawn them. It is perhaps less easy to
suggest that the columns stood farther forward than De Witt has placed
them, but the roof may well have projected farther over them. They are
solid enough to bear a much greater weight than the drawing indicates.
However these things may have been at the Swan&mdash;I am not blind to
the dangers of attempting to convert what De Witt has shown into
something which he has not shown&mdash;one may, perhaps, infer that more
extensive roofing than the pent-house of the drawing would afford was
contemplated by the Fortune contract, which provides for ‘a shadowe or
cover over the saide stadge’, and the Hope contract, which is even more
precise in its specification of ‘the Heavens all over the saide stage’.
In both cases there were to be gutters to carry away rain-water. The
heavens at the Hope were ‘to be borne or carryed without any postes
or supporters to be fixed or sett uppon the saide stage’, and it has
been thought that other theatres of later date than the Swan may also
have dispensed with posts. But there is little ground for this theory,
other than the obvious obstruction which the posts would offer to
vision.<a id="FNanchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">[1721]</a> Howes seems to refer to the arrangement at the Hope as
an innovation, and it can hardly be unrelated to the special need for
a removable stage at that house. On the other hand the posts may very
likely have been slighter than De Witt has shown them. At the Fortune
they were, like other ‘princypall and maine postes’, square and carved
‘palasterwise’ with satyrs. The posts are worked into the action of
several plays, and Kempe tells us that pickpockets were pilloried by
being tied to them.<a id="FNanchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">[1722]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[546]</span></p>

<p>The hut has two windows in front, and a door in the visible side. It
has been suggested that it may really have stood rather more forward
than De Witt indicates, jutting out from the tire-house so as to be
directly over a part of the heavens.<a id="FNanchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">[1723]</a> An analogous superstructure
is observable in most of the map-representations of theatres. That
of the later Globe in Visscher’s map of 1616 seems to have two bays,
one behind another, instead of the one bay of the Swan drawing, and
would have required more space. The ‘Theatrum’ of Jonson’s 1616 Folio
has an <b>L</b>-shaped superstructure. The object of a jut forward
would be to facilitate the descents and ascents from and to the
heavens, which formed popular features in many plays, and which must
have been contrived by some kind of machinery from above.<a id="FNanchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">[1724]</a> From
the roof of this hut floats a flag, with the figure of a swan upon
it, and at the door stands a man, apparently blowing a trumpet, from
which depends a smaller flag also bearing a swan. There is abundant
evidence that the play-houses flew flags when they were open for
performances, and took them down when Lent or a plague rendered playing
impossible.<a id="FNanchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">[1725]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[547]</span> trumpeter is no doubt giving one of the three
‘soundings’ which preluded the appearance of the prologue in his
traditional long black velvet cloak.<a id="FNanchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">[1726]</a> Nor did the flag and the
trumpet exhaust the resources of the Elizabethan art of advertisement.
The <i>vexillatores</i> of the miracle-play would perhaps have been
out of keeping with London conditions.<a id="FNanchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a> But it was customary to
announce after the epilogue of each performance what the next was to
be.<a id="FNanchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">[1728]</a> And public notification was given by means of play-bills,
of which we hear from as early a date as 1564, and which were set
up on posts in conspicuous places up and down the city and probably
also at the play-house doors.<a id="FNanchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">[1729]</a> Copies seem also to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[548]</span>
available for circulation from hand to hand.<a id="FNanchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a> On 30 October 1587
John Charlwood entered in the Stationers’ Register a licence for
‘the onely ympryntinge of all manner of billes for players’. This
passed from him to James Roberts, and was transferred by Roberts to
William Jaggard on 29 October 1615.<a id="FNanchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">[1731]</a> No theatrical bill of the
Elizabethan or Jacobean period is preserved, although a manuscript
bill for the Bear Garden is amongst Alleyn’s papers at Dulwich.<a id="FNanchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">[1732]</a>
Four late seventeenth-century bills are at Claydon; they are brief
announcements, which give the names of the plays, but not those of the
authors or actors.<a id="FNanchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">[1733]</a> There is no evidence of anything corresponding
to the modern programme, with its cast and synopsis of scenes.<a id="FNanchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">[1734]</a>
The audience gathered early, as there were few, if any, reserved
seats.<a id="FNanchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">[1735]</a> The period of waiting was spent in consuming fruit or
sweatmeats and liquid refreshment, and in expressing impatience if the
actors failed to make an appearance in good time.<a id="FNanchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">[1736]</a> Tobacco was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[549]</span>
freely used, especially by the gallants on the stage.<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a> Books were
also hawked up and down, and a game of cards might beguile the tedium
of waiting.<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a> The galleries were full of light women, who found
them a profitable haunt, but whose presence did not altogether prevent
that of ladies of position, probably in the private rooms, and possibly
masked.<a id="FNanchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">[1739]</a></p>

<p>If the audience liked a play, the actors expected a <i>Plaudite</i>
of hand-clapping; if otherwise, they took their chance of hissing
and ‘mewing’, or of a pointed withdrawal of spectators from the
stage.<a id="FNanchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">[1740]</a> The device of a <i>claque</i> was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[550]</span> unknown.<a id="FNanchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">[1741]</a>
The applause was often invited in the closing speech or in a formal
epilogue, on the same lines as the prologue, which it seems to have
replaced in favour about the end of the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">[1742]</a>
This might also lead up to or perhaps represent the prayer for the
sovereign, of which there are traces up to a late date, and which
was analogous to the modern use of ‘God Save the King’.<a id="FNanchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">[1743]</a> The
accompanying prayer for the ‘lord’ of the players, on the other hand,
cannot be shown to have been adopted into the public theatres.<a id="FNanchor_1744" href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">[1744]</a>
Finally, the epilogue might indicate a coming dance.<a id="FNanchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">[1745]</a> Of this a
little more needs to be said. The players have amongst other elements
in their ancestry the mediaeval mimes, and they inherit the familiar
mimic tradition of multifarious entertainment. The ‘legitimate’ drama
was not as yet on its pedestal. The companies of the ’eighties and even
the early ’nineties were composed of men ready at need to eke out their
plays by musical performances and even the ‘activities’ of acrobats.
This is perhaps most obvious in the continental companies, which
had to face the obstacles to a complete intelligence between stage
and audience introduced at the tower of Babel. Such a cosmopolitan
mingling of drama and ‘activities’ as we may suppose <i>The Labours
of Hercules</i> to have been was a valuable resource.<a id="FNanchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">[1746]</a> But at
home also we find Strange’s and the Admiral’s men showing their
‘activities’ at court, and Symons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[551]</span> the acrobat becoming a leader
amongst the Queen’s, and even so late as 1601 Henslowe fitting out the
Admiral’s boy Nick to tumble in the presence of royalty. The country
tours of the Queen’s were for some time accompanied by a Turkish rope
dancer.<a id="FNanchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">[1747]</a> In the theatres themselves Italian players made their
success and their scandal, with the help of tumbling women.<a id="FNanchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">[1748]</a>
Whether English players did the same we do not know. But we do know
that the dance by way of afterpiece was a regular and enduring
custom.<a id="FNanchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">[1749]</a> It was known as the jig.<a id="FNanchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">[1750]</a> At first, perhaps,
nothing more than such dancing, with the help of a variety of foreign
costumes, as was also an element in the early masks, it developed into
a farcical dialogue, with a musical and Terpsichorean accompaniment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[552]</span>
for which popular tunes, such as <i>Fading</i>, were utilized.<a id="FNanchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">[1751]</a>
This transformation was perhaps due to the initiative of Tarlton, to
whom several jigs are attributed.<a id="FNanchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">[1752]</a> But he was followed by Kempe
and others, and in the last decade of the sixteenth century the jig
may be inferred from the Stationers’ Register to have become almost a
literary type.<a id="FNanchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">[1753]</a> Nashe in 1596 threatens Gabriel Harvey with an
interlude, and ‘a Jigge at the latter end in English Hexameters of
<i>O neighbour Gabriell, and his wooing of Kate Cotton</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">[1754]</a> In
1597 Henslowe bought two jigs from two young men for the Admiral’s
at a cost of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i><a id="FNanchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">[1755]</a> In 1598 ‘Kemps Jigge’ was
being sung in the streets.<a id="FNanchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">[1756]</a> The Middlesex justices made a
special order against the lewd jigs, songs, and dances at the Fortune
in 1612.<a id="FNanchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">[1757]</a> Unfortunately few jigs have survived except from a
late date or in German adaptations.<a id="FNanchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">[1758]</a> Two or three, however,
appear amongst collections of ballads to which they are cognate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[553]</span> in
metrical form, notably one ascribed to ‘M<sup>r</sup> Attowel’, whom we should,
I think, identify with the sixteenth-century George, rather than the
seventeenth-century Hugh, of that name.<a id="FNanchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">[1759]</a> Another, <i>Rowland’s
Godson</i>, seems to be the surviving member of a well-known
cycle.<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">[1760]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the jig the only form of afterpiece which had its savour in
an Elizabethan play-house. Tarlton again, and after Tarlton Wilson,
won reputation in the handling of ‘themes’, which appear to have been
improvisations in verse, strung together on some motive supplied by
a member of the audience.<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">[1761]</a> It has been suggested that complete
plays were also sometimes given by the method of improvised dialogue
on a concerted plot which was followed in the Italian <i>commedie
dell’ arte</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">[1762]</a> This must remain very doubtful. The Italian
practice and the stock characters, pantaloon, zany, and harlequin, of
the <i>commedie dell’ arte</i> were certainly known in England; but we
have the clear evidence of <i>The Case is Altered</i> that by 1597 at
any rate they had not been naturalized.<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">[1763]</a> If improvisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[554]</span> went
beyond the gagging of a clown, it was probably only in some exceptional
experiment or <i>tour de force</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">[1764]</a> As exceptional also we may
regard Vennar’s spectacular <i>Englands Joy</i> of 1602 and the wager
plays, in which actors or even amateurs challenged each other to
compete in rendering some ‘part’ of traditional repute.<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">[1765]</a> One would
like to know more about the play, apparently a monologue, ‘set out al
by one virgin’, at the Theatre in 1583.<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">[1766]</a></p>

<p>Many of the characteristics of the public theatres naturally repeated
themselves at the Blackfriars, the Whitefriars, and Paul’s. The
distinctive features of these, as already indicated, arose from the
structure of the buildings, from the higher prices charged, and in the
beginning at least from the employment of singing boys as actors. Some
assimilation of ‘public’ and ‘private’ methods was bound to follow
upon the acquisition of the Blackfriars by men actors in 1609, but the
period during which this was the principal house of the King’s company
lies outside the scope of this survey.</p>

<p>The exact location of Paul’s is obscure, but we know that its
auditorium was round and its stage small.<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">[1767]</a> Whitefriars and both
the earlier and the later Blackfriars were in rooms which had formed
part of mediaeval conventual buildings, rectangular, roofed, and more
analogous to courtly halls than to popular rings. No room at Farrant’s
disposal would have given him a stage of a greater width than 27 ft.
Burbadge’s theatre was 66 ft. from north to south, and 46 ft. from
east to west. It was on the second story of his purchase that he could
have best constructed it. The stage, which stood on a paved floor, was
probably towards the south end, and as the whole space available was
something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[555]</span> like 100 ft. long by 52 wide, we may guess that partitions
had been put up to screen off a tiring-house behind it and a passage
by which the tiring-house could be reached.<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">[1768]</a> The entrance would
be at the north end, where a great flight of stairs led up from a
yard large enough for coaches to turn in. There were galleries, but
not necessarily three distinct tiers of galleries, as in the public
theatres, for which, indeed, there would hardly have been height
enough.<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">[1769]</a> And there was a ‘middle region’ in which the spectators
sat, instead of standing as they did in the public ‘yards’.<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">[1770]</a> This,
which was a feature also of the later private houses, came to be known
as the ‘pit’, but as the derivation of this term is from ‘cockpit’,
it may not be of earlier origin than the building of the Cockpit or
Phoenix theatre in Drury Lane about 1617.<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">[1771]</a> A roofed theatre would
not require a specially constructed ‘heavens’, as descents could
be worked through the ceiling from a room above. There is no clear
evidence for a lord’s room at any of the private houses.<a id="FNanchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">[1772]</a> But
there were ‘boxes’, at any rate at the Whitefriars.<a id="FNanchor_1773" href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">[1773]</a> Evidence
for seats on the stage has already been furnished. There is much to
suggest that the audience was a more select one than that of the public
theatres.<a id="FNanchor_1774" href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">[1774]</a> Elizabeth cannot be shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[556]</span> to have ever attended the
Blackfriars, but Anne certainly did.<a id="FNanchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">[1775]</a> And the price of the seats,
which ranged from 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, was of itself
sufficient to keep out persons of the ‘groundling’ or ‘stinkard’
type.<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[1776]</a> Performances did not necessarily take place every day,
and they could begin rather later and go on rather longer than those
out of doors, since they were not dependent on daylight.<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[1777]</a>
Windows were certainly used, for we hear of them being clapped down
to give the illusion of night scenes.<a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[1778]</a> But candles and torches
supplied an artificial lighting.<a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">[1779]</a> As both the Paul’s boys and
those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[557]</span> the Chapel were primarily choristers, it is not surprising
that music played a considerable part in the entertainment provided.
Musical interludes were given between the acts, and Gerschow records a
preliminary concert of an hour in length before the play began at the
Blackfriars in 1602.<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">[1780]</a> Sometimes also a boy came forward and danced
between the acts.<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[1781]</a> At Paul’s there was at the back of the stage
a ‘musick tree’, which apparently rose out of a ‘canopie’ and bore a
‘musick house’ on either side of it.<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">[1782]</a></p>

grammar, the schoolmaster of St. Paul’s claims 5<i>s.</i> a year for
teaching them, though he ought to demand nothing for them, because he
keeps the school for them, as the Treasurer of St. Paul’s once alleged
before the Dean and Chapter is to be found in ancient deeds’. Mr. Leach
adds, ‘It is to be feared the Treasurer invented or misrepresented
the ancient deed’. William de Tolleshunt, almoner, appears from his
will of 1329 in the same register to have taught his boys himself
(<i>Archaeologia</i>, lxii. 1. 220), ‘Item lego pueris ecclesiae quos
ego educavi senioribus in Elemosinaria existentibus cuilibet xij<sup>d</sup> et
iunioribus cuilibet vj<sup>d</sup>’. He also left his grammar books ‘et omnes

praedicta imperpetuum, ad usum fructum puerorum in eadem degencium’.

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> Wallace, i. 77, goes against the evidence when he
asserts that Heywood wrote for the Chapel. Why he asserts that Heywood
‘had grown up in the Chapel under Cornish’, to whom, by the way, he
wantonly transfers the authorship of <i>The Four P. P.</i>, <i>The
Pardoner and the Frere</i>, and <i>Johan Johan</i>, I do not know.
There is nothing to show that Heywood was a Chapel boy, and the absence
of his name from the Chapel list of 1509 (cf. p. 27), when he would
have been about twelve, may be taken as disposing of the notion. He
is first discoverable at Court in December 1514, for which month he
received wages at the rate of viij<sup>d</sup> a day in some undefined capacity
(<i>Chamber Account</i> in <i>Addl. MS.</i> 21481, f. 178), which was
shared by one John Mason, who was a Yeoman of the Crown by March 1516
(Brewer, ii. 475). By 1520 Heywood himself was a Yeoman of the Crown
(Brewer, iii. 1. 499), and during 1519–21 the <i>Chamber Accounts</i>
show him as also a ‘singer’ at £5 a quarter. Later he became player
of the virginals, and has 50<i>s.</i> a quarter as such in the
<i>Accounts</i> for 1529–31, 1538–41, and 1547–9. He was Sewer of the
Chamber at the funeral of Edward in 1553. It occurs to me as just
possible that Heywood’s ‘children’ may have been neither the Chapel nor
the Paul’s boys, but the boys taken up by Philip Van Wilder for the
musical establishment of the Household; cf. p. 31. But I think it is
more likely that Heywood wrote for the Paul’s boys throughout, as he
almost certainly did in 1559. There is another hint of his connexion
with them in the fact that at the coronation of Mary in 1553 he sat
under a vine against the grammar school and made speeches (Holinshed
(1808), iv. 6). A. W. Reed (1917, <i>3 Library</i>, viii. 247) adds
facts, and thinks the Yeoman was distinct.</p>

Mulliner are associated, and one of these, <i>Addl. MS.</i> 30513,
is inscribed ‘Sum liber Thomae Mullineri, Johanne Heywoode teste’.
Stafford Smith, on what authority is unknown, stated (cf. <i>D. N.

have come between Redford and Westcott. On 3 March 1564 he was admitted
as organist in Corpus Christi College, Oxford (Fowler, <i>Hist. of

his will, dated on 3 April and proved on 14 April 1582. He describes
himself as almoner of St. Paul’s, dwelling in the almonry and born at
Chimley in Devonshire; appoints Henry Evans overseer and Justinian
Kyd executor, and leaves legacies to relatives (apparently he had
no children or wife), to members of the Redford family, to ‘Gyles
Clothier’, to the ten choristers, to ‘sometimes children of the said
almenerey’, by name Bromeham, Richard Huse, Robert Knight, Nicholas
Carleton, Baylye, Nasion, and Gregory Bowringe, to ‘Shepard that
keepeth the door at playes’, and to Pole ‘the keper of the gate’.
Wallace, i. 171, cites the will from <i>P. C. C.</i> 14 and 31,
Tirwhite, giving the date of confirmation as 3 July 1582. One name may
be added to Westcott’s list of boys from a Court Minute of Christ’s
Hospital on 5 March 1580 (<i>Musical Times</i>, 1 Jan. 1907), ‘M<sup>r</sup>.
Sebastian, of Paulls, is appointed to have Hallawaie the younger out of
this House to be one of the singing children of the Cathedral Church of
Paulls in this Citie’.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> Gosson (1582) speaks of the plays as ‘at Paules’; and
Rawlidge (1628) mentions a house ‘nigh Pauls’ as one of those pulled
down by the City, apparently in 1596 (cf. ch. xvi). The Paul’s boys,
however, can hardly have been playing for some years before that date.
Howes (1629) definitely specifies the singing school (cf. ch. xvi). On
the other hand, Flecknoe, a late authority and in a passage dealing
(inaccurately) with Jacobean rather than Elizabethan conditions,
assigns the plays to ‘behinde the Convocation-house in Paul’s’ (App.
I). This is expanded by Malone (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 46) into ‘in
S<sup>t</sup>. Paul’s school-room, behind the Convocation-house’, and Baker,
45, suggests that they used a small yard or cloister before the doors
of the Convocation House and shut off by a high wall from the main
churchyard (cf. Hollar’s prints in Baker, 95, 115). But I doubt if
Flecknoe had anything in mind except St. Gregory’s, which stood just
west of the Convocation House. The hall of the College of Minor Canons
is perhaps also a possibility; but neither this nor the church is
likely to have afforded a circular auditorium (cf. ch. xviii). Can they
have used the Convocation House itself?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> McDonnell, 27, argues for the participation of the
grammar school in the plays. Obviously the phrase ‘children of Paul’s’,
ordinarily used of the playing-boys, proves nothing one way or the
other. That the plays were mainly an affair of the choir is a fair
inference from the fact that they were presented at Court by the
song-school masters. But there is no reason to doubt that the mediaeval
give and take between the two schools continued through the sixteenth
century. Hunter, <i>Chorus Vatum</i>, v. 542, quotes a manuscript life
of Sir Thomas Offley, ‘This Thomas Offley became a good grammarian
under Mr. [William] Lillie and understood the Latin tongue perfectly;
and because he had a sweet voice he was put to learn prick-song
among the choristers of St. Paul’s, for that learned Mr. Lillie
knew full well that knowledge in music was a help and a furtherance
to all arts’. On the other hand, Dean Nowell (Churton, <i>Life of
A. Nowell</i>, 190) instructed Thomas Giles in 1584 to teach the
choristers catechism, writing, and music, and then to ‘suffer them to
resort to Paul’s School that they may learn the principles of Grammar’.
Some seventeenth-century performances by the grammar school, after the
regular Paul’s plays ceased, are upon record.</p>

were a Sub-dean, 7 Ministers, the Master of the Children, an Organist,
22 ordinary Gentlemen, and a Clerk of the Check; also a Sergeant, 2
Yeomen, and a Groom of the Vestry. This agrees with the Elizabethan fee
lists, which give the total number of Gentlemen as 32. The coronation
list does not name Epistolers; but it is clear from the notices of
appointments in Rimbault, 1, that a Gospeller and Epistoler were
appointed, as next in succession to the Gentlemen’s places, although it
does not appear that they were necessarily ex-Children. There were also
Extraordinary Gentlemen (Rimbault, 31).</p>

‘at all times when his Highnesse shall lye in his castle of Windsor,
his mannors of Bewlye, Richmond, Hampton Court, Greenwich, Eltham, or
Woodstock’; but ‘in rideing journeys and progresses’, only the Master
of the Children, six men, six children, and some officers of the vestry
are to attend. In the seventeenth century ‘all removinge weekes’ were
amongst the ‘auntient tymes of lyberty and playinge weekes’ (Rimbault,
73). But the practice may have varied. Stopes, 252, gives a Stable
warrant of 1554 for a wagon ‘for the necessarie conveying and cariage
of the Children of our Chapel and their man from place to place, at
such seasons, as they by our commandment shall remove to serve where

<p><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">[63]</a> A chapel of St. Stephen existed in 1205. It was rebuilt
and made a free collegiate chapel in 1348, and dissolved in 1547, and
the building assigned as a chamber for the House of Commons (J. T.
Smith, <i>Antiquities of Westminster</i>, 72; <i>V. H. London</i>, i.
566). It may have originated as a domestic chapel, but seems to be
quite distinct from the Household Chapel by the sixteenth century.
Thus its St. Nicholas Bishop had an old annual reward of £1 from the
Exchequer (Devon, <i>Issues of Exchequer</i>, 222; R. Henry, <i>Hist.
of Great Britain</i><sup>3</sup>, xii. 459; Brewer, iv. 869), while the Household
boys got their reward of £6 12<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> from the Treasurer
of the Chamber. Wallace, i. 22, notes that the Masters of the Children
‘all lived’ at Greenwich, which suggests that this was the Tudor
head-quarters of the Chapel.</p>

to a boy Robin, whom Henry VIII wished to transfer from Wolsey’s chapel
to his own. It was stipulated that Cornish should treat him honestly,
‘otherwise than he doth his own’, and later Cornish wrote praising the
clean singing and descant of the recruit (Brewer, ii. 1246–50).</p>

annual Christmas rewards paid by the Treasurer of the Chamber to the
Gentlemen, which went on to the end of the reign, were for plays. But
these were of £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, whereas the reward for a play
was £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> They were paid on Twelfth Night, and are
sometimes said to be for ‘payne taking’ during Christmas. In 1510 they
had an extra £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for praying for the Queen’s good
deliverance. The ‘payne taking’ was no doubt as singers. An order of
Henry VII’s time (<i>H. O.</i> 121) for the wassail on Twelfth Night
has, ‘Item, the chappell to stand on the one side of the hall, and
when the steward cometh in at the hall doore with the wassell, he must
crie three tymes, Wassell, wassell, wassell; and then the chappell
to answere with a good songe’. The Gentlemen also had 40<i>s.</i>
annually from the Treasurer of the Chamber ‘to drink with their bucks’
given them for a summer feast, which was still held in the seventeenth
century (Rimbault, 122).</p>

puzzling to find in a list of Exchequer fees payable during the year
ended Michaelmas 1508 (R. Henry, <i>Hist. of Great Britain</i><sup>3</sup>, xii.

at Arthur’s wedding, and a William ‘jun.’ who must have joined the
Chapel in 1503 or 1504 and became Master of the Children. The older
William may be identical with the Westminster (q.v.) choir-master of
1479–80. A Christopher or ‘Kit’ Cornish, referred to by Stopes, 17,
and elsewhere, had no existence. This is a ghost-name, due to the
juxtaposition of ‘kyte’, i.e. Sir John Kite, afterwards Archbishop of
Armagh, and ‘Cornisshe’ in the 1508 record above.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="label">[87]</a> Matthew Welder appears as a lute and viol at Court in
1516 and 1517. Peter Welder was appointed in 1519 and is traceable to
1559, as a lute, viol, or flute. Henry van Wilder was a ‘musician’,
1553–8. Philip Welder or van Wilder himself is first noted as a
‘minstrel’ in 1526. Later he was a lute up to 1554. In 1547 he was also
‘of the Privy Chamber’ and keeper of the King’s musical instruments
(Nagel, 6, 13, 15, 16, 18, 22, 24, 27; Lafontaine, 8, 9, 12; Brewer,
i, cxi). He died 24 Jan. 1554, leaving a son, Henry, probably the one
noted above (Fry, <i>London Inquisitions</i>, i. 117). The <i>Chamber
Accounts</i> for 1538–41 show an allowance to him of £70 ‘for six
singing children’ (Stopes, 12). Several references to ‘Philippe and his
fellows yong mynstrels’ and to ‘the children that be in the keeping
of Philip and Edmund Harmon’ appear in Green Cloth documents from 30
June 1538 to 1544 (<i>H. O.</i> 166, 172, 191, 208; <i>Genealogist</i>,
xxx. 23). Edmund Harmon was one of the royal Barbers. Finally, livery
lists of 1547 show nine singing men and children under ‘M<sup>r</sup>. Phelips’
(Lafontaine, 7). An earlier company of ‘the King’s young minstrels’
than this of 1538–50 seems to have been lodged at court <i>c.</i>
1526 (Brewer, iv. 1. 865), and there were ‘troyes autres nos ioesnes
ministralx’ as far back as 1369 (<i>Life Records of Chaucer</i>,

children for singing’, but there is no indication that the posts were

<p><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">[91]</a> It is possible that the Treasurer of the Chamber did not
pay all the rewards for plays during the earlier years of the reign;
but the suggestion of Wallace, i. 108, that, if we had the <i>Books of
Queen’s Payments</i>, more information might be available, seems to
show a failure to realize the identity of the Tudor <i>Books of King’s
Payments</i> with the <i>T. of C. Accounts</i>. There might, however,
be rewards in a book subsidiary to the <i>Privy Purse Accounts</i>. I
do not think that much can be made of the recital of ‘playes’ as well
as ‘maskes’ in the preamble of the <i>Revels Accounts</i> for 1558–9,
during which the T. of C. paid no rewards, since this may be merely
‘common form’.</p>

Dec. 1731. The pamphlet is also cited for an example of the use of the

that the euphuistic prose plays at the Bel Savage mentioned by Gosson,

Greenstreet and Fleay, as ‘Marti decimo quinto Decembris Anno xliiij
Elizabeth Regine’; the date set down for trial is indicated as ‘p Octab
Hillar’. This agrees with the time indication of the offence in the
complaint itself as ‘about one yere last past, and since your maiesties
last free and generall pardon’. The pardon referred to must be that of
1597–8 (<i>39 Eliz.</i> c. 28; cf. <i>R. O. Statutes</i>, iv. 952).
There was another passed by the Parliament of 1601 (<i>43 Eliz.</i> c.
19; cf. <i>Statutes</i>, iv. 1010) for all offences prior to 7 Aug.
1601, but presumably this was not yet law when the complaint was drawn.

the three and ffortieth yeare’ of Elizabeth, i.e. 1600–1, which is
not exact. The reference can hardly be to any other than the Clifton
affair. No Chancery documents in the case, other than the complaint,
are known. It may be presumed that censure fell on Giles and Robinson,
as well as Evans, but they were not concerned in <i>K. v. P.</i>
Evans, of course, was technically acting as deputy to Giles under his
commission, and Wallace, ii. 71, is not justified in citing the case
as evidence that ‘These powers to Giles were supplemented by official
concessions to Henry Evans that enabled him to rent the Blackfriars
theatre and train the Queen’s Children of the Chapel there, with
remunerative privileges’.</p>

These are recitals. Wallace, ii. 91, says that he has found two copies
of the original bond, but the text he prints adds nothing to <i>K. v.
P.</i> 240. Clearly he is wrong in describing it as ‘containing the
Articles of Agreement’. That was a much more detailed document, which
Evans unfortunately thought so ‘long and tedious’ that he did not
insert it at large in his Answer in <i>K. v. P.</i> It was doubtless
analogous to the King’s Revels Articles of 1608 (cf. <i>infra</i>). It
provided for the rights of the partners to the use of rooms (<i>E. v.
K.</i> 211) and presumably for the division of profits (<i>K. v. P.</i>
237).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_136" href="#FNanchor_136" class="label">[136]</a> <i>K. v. P.</i> 244. Wallace, ii. 102, adds the actual
terms of the bond. He takes Evans’s explanation to mean that hitherto
Evans had maintained the boys and the plays out of official funds
supplied through Kirkham as Yeoman of the Revels, but that now Evans’s
name was to be kept out of the business, and disbursements made by his
partners, who were to pay him 8<i>s.</i> a week as a kind of steward.
I cannot suppose that Kirkham had been the channel of any official
subvention, and, on the whole, think it probable that the second
‘compl<sup>t</sup>’ in the extract from the pleading is an error for ‘def<sup>t</sup>’.
This leaves it not wholly clear why Evans should allege his relief from
great weekly disbursements as a reason for receiving 8<i>s.</i> a week;
but if we had the Articles of Agreement, the point would probably be
clear. Possibly Evans had in the past made the equivalent of a weekly
sum of 8<i>s.</i> out of board-wages passed on to him by Giles.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_157" href="#FNanchor_157" class="label">[157]</a> Kirkham and Kendall were still associated in Aug. 1605,
when apparel and properties were obtained from them for the plays
at James’s visit to Oxford (<i>M. S. C.</i> i. 247). There was a
performance at the Blackfriars as late as 16 June 1605 (Wallace, ii.
125), a date connected with a dispute in settlement of which Kirkham’s
bond of £50 to Evans was exchanged for a new one to Hawkins (<i>K. v.
P.</i> 244).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_158" href="#FNanchor_158" class="label">[158]</a> Cf. <i>M. L. R.</i> iv. 159. The t.p. of
<i>Sophonisba</i> only specifies performance ‘at the Blackfriars’;
those of <i>The Fleir</i> and <i>The Isle of Gulls</i> ‘by the Children
of the Revels at the Blackfriars’. Probably the ‘Children of the
Revels’ of the t.p. of Day’s <i>Law Tricks</i> (1608) is also the
Blackfriars company. No theatre is named, but the play is too early for
the King’s Revels, who, moreover, do not seem to be described on other
t.ps. as ‘Children of the Revels’ pure and simple. I take it that these
t.p. descriptions follow the designations of the companies in use when
the plays were last on the stage before publication, rather than those
in use at the times of first production.</p>

272, f. 27 (1614) and <i>Stowe MS.</i> 575, f. 24 (1616), but a group
of the early part of the reign (<i>Addl. MS.</i> 35848, f. 19; <i>Addl.

at £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, which some one has corrected by inserting
the normal entry. All this suggests that many copyists of fee-lists
in the seventeenth century confused the post of interlude player with
that of a lute player, and the former was therefore probably obsolete,
and its fee no longer paid to the royal players of the day (cf.
ch. x). I cannot agree with E. Law, <i>Shakespeare a Groom, of the
Chamber</i>, 26, 64, that the interlude players survived under James
as ‘mummers, who, perhaps, sang in a sort of recitative at masques and
anti-masques’.</p>

and Hazlitt, <i>E. D. S.</i> 25, printed the Signet Bill, erroneously
describing it as the Privy Seal, from the State Paper Office. This
has the omitted words, and Collier correctly explains the omission in
Steevens’s text as due to an inaccurate copyist, pointing in proof to
the words ‘in oure <i>said</i> Citye of London’. This did not, however,
prevent Fleay, 45, from asserting that in the Patent ‘an alteration had
been made from the Privy Seal’, on the ground that its terms ‘infringed
on the powers of the City authorities’. Such an alteration not merely
did not take place, but would have been a diplomatic impossibility, as
the Patent Roll was made up, not from the Letters Patent, but from the

fantastic form in the suggestion of Lee<sup>1</sup>, 33, that Shakespeare was
already in London, but ‘Shakespeare’s friends may have called the
attention of the strolling players to the homeless youth, rumours of
whose search for employment about the London theatres had doubtless
reached Stratford’.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_311" href="#FNanchor_311" class="label">[311]</a> The illustration of Mr. Fleay’s methods of constructing
stage history is delightful. In <i>The True Tragedie of Richard the
Third</i>, a Queen’s play, the murderers of the princes in the Tower
are Will Slawter or Sluter, ‘yet the most part calles him blacke Will’
(Hazlitt, <i>Sh. L.</i> v. 95), and Jack Denten or Douton. On this Mr.
Fleay (ii. 316) comments, ‘One of the actors in it, Sc. 11, is called
Will Slaughter, “yet the most part calls him Black Will”, <i>i.e.</i>
the Black Will of <i>Arden of Faversham</i>, q.v., which had no doubt
been acted by the same man. Another actor is called Jack Donton
(Dutton) or Denten, an accommodation of the Dighton of history to the
actor’s real name.’ Obviously there is no need to suppose that the
characters in <i>The True Tragedie</i> bore the names of their actors.
John Dutton is not very likely to have taken a part of four speeches,
and Will Slawter is evidently added to the John Dighton of Holinshed,
to give Edward V the ‘irony’ of a pun upon ‘slaughter’. As for <i>Arden
of Faversham</i>, it is not known to have been a Queen’s play at all,
and its ‘Black Will’ is taken from Holinshed. Having gone so far, I
do not know why Mr. Fleay stopped short of identifying Black Will’s
colleague ‘Shakebag’ with the name of an actor. Of course, Mr. Fleay’s
blundering conjectures must be distinguished from the deliberate
fabrications of Collier, who published in his <i>New Facts</i>,
11, from a forged document amongst the <i>Bridgewater MSS.</i>, a
certificate to the Privy Council under the date ‘Nov. 1589’, from ‘her
Ma<sup>ts</sup> poore playeres James Burbidge Richard Burbidge John Laneham
Thomas Greene Robert Wilson John Taylor Anth. Wadeson Thomas Pope
George Peele Augustine Phillippes Nicholas Towley William Shakespeare

attaches to <i>Tamburlaine</i> (30 Aug. 1594) and <i>Long Meg of
Westminster</i> (14 Feb. 1595) as equivalent to ‘ne’. Were it so,
these would furnish two, and the only two, examples of a second new
production in a single week. Probably ‘j’ indicates in both instances
the <i>First Part</i> of a two-part play. This view is confirmed by
Henslowe’s note on 10 March 1595, ‘17 p[laies] frome hence lycensed’;

300; the manuscript is now lost. The various sections of the document
are headed: (<i>a</i>) ‘The booke of the Inventary of the goods of
my lord Admeralles men, tacken the 10 of Marche in the yeare 1598’;
(<i>b</i>) ‘The Enventary of the Clownes sewtes and Hermetes Swetes,
with dievers others sewtes, as followeth, 1598, the 10 of March’;
(<i>c</i>) ‘The Enventary of all the aparell for my Lord Admiralles
men, tacken the 10 of Marche 1598&mdash;Leaft above in the tier-house in the
cheast’; (<i>d</i>) ‘The Enventary tacken of all the properties for my
Lord Admeralles men, the 10 of Marche 1598’; (<i>e</i>) ‘The Enventorey
of all the aparell of the Lord Admeralles men, taken the 13<sup>th</sup> of
Marche 1598, as followeth’; (<i>f</i>) ‘A Note of all suche bookes as
belong to the Stocke, and such as I have bought since the 3<sup>d</sup> of Marche
1598’; (<i>g</i>) ‘A Note of all suche goodes as I have bought for
the Companey of my Lord Admirals men, sence the 3 of Aprell, 1598, as
followeth’. A comparison of the book-list with the diary payments makes
it clear that ‘1598’ is 1597/8 and not 1598/9. The last book entered
was bought in Aug. 1598. An undated inventory of Alleyn’s private
theatrical wardrobe is in <i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 52.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_471" href="#FNanchor_471" class="label">[471]</a> Regarded by Dr. Greg as <i>2 Hannibal and Hermes</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_472" href="#FNanchor_472" class="label">[472]</a> I agree with Dr. Greg that this, for which Chapman had
£4 in 1598–9, is probably identical with <i>The Isle of a Woman</i>,
for which he had had earnests of £4 or £4 10<i>s.</i> in 1597–8.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_473" href="#FNanchor_473" class="label">[473]</a> I think the play licensed as <i>Brute Grenshallde</i>
in March 1599 was a second part written by Chettle to an old <i>1
Brute</i> by Day, which would not need re-licensing.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_474" href="#FNanchor_474" class="label">[474]</a> I do not see with what to identify the play licensed
under this name in March 1599 except the unnamed ‘playe boocke’ and
‘tragedie’, for which Chapman had something under £9 in the previous
Oct. and Jan.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_475" href="#FNanchor_475" class="label">[475]</a> The title <i>War without Blows and Love without

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_476" href="#FNanchor_476" class="label">[476]</a> I agree with Dr. Greg that the entries point to two
plays by Chettle and Dekker rather than one. They are probably
incomplete owing to the hiatus in the manuscript.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_477" href="#FNanchor_477" class="label">[477]</a> Dr. Greg makes two plays of this, but the entry ‘his
boocke called the world rones a whelles &amp; now all foolles but the
foolle’ seems unambiguous, and the total payments of £8 10<i>s.</i> are
not too high for a play by Chapman.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_478" href="#FNanchor_478" class="label">[478]</a> No importance can be attached to Mr. Fleay’s childish
identifications of <i>War without Blows and Love without Suit</i>,
<i>Joan as Good as my Lady</i>, and <i>The Four Kings</i> with <i>The
Thracian Wonder</i>, Heywood’s <i>A Maidenhead well Lost</i>, and
<i>Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes</i> respectively.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_482" href="#FNanchor_482" class="label">[482]</a> The only entry is of 15 July ‘to bye a boocke’, but the

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_483" href="#FNanchor_483" class="label">[483]</a> Here also the hiatus has only left an entry of £2 ‘in
full payment’ on 1 Aug. Dr. Greg, however, would identify <i>Bear a
Brain</i> and <i>The Gentle Craft</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_484" href="#FNanchor_484" class="label">[484]</a> The entries are as follows: 2 Sept., ‘Thomas Deckers
Bengemen Johnson Hary Chettell &amp; other Jentellman in earneste of a
playe calle Robart the second kinge of Scottes tragedie’; 15 Sept., ‘in
earneste of a boocke called the Scottes tragedi vnto Thomas Dickers &amp;
Harey Chettell’; 16 Sept., ‘Hary Chettell ... in earneste of a boocke
called the Scottes tragedie’; 27 Sept., ‘Bengemen Johnsone in earneste
of a boocke called the Scottes tragedie’; 28 Sept., ‘vnto M<sup>r</sup> Maxton
the new poete in earneste of a boocke called [blank]’. Dr. Greg resists
the fairly reasonable identification of ‘M<sup>r</sup> Maxton the new poete’ with
the ‘other Jentellman’. All the payments are called earnests, but the
total is £6 10<i>s.</i> and therefore the play probably existed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_485" href="#FNanchor_485" class="label">[485]</a> ‘Lent vnto me W Birde the 9 of Februarye to paye for a
new booke to Will Boyle cald Jugurth xxx<sup>s</sup> which if you dislike Ile
repaye it back.’ The price is the lowest ever entered for a ‘new’ book.
Mr. Fleay’s suggestion that Will Bird, who already had one alias in
Will Borne, was also himself Will Boyle, is one of those irresponsible
guesses by which he has done so much to make hay of theatrical history.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_489" href="#FNanchor_489" class="label">[489]</a> This was taken up again in 1601, but still not finished.
Dr. Greg, however, thinks that it is identical with Day’s Italian
tragedy, and forms half of <i>Two Lamentable Tragedies</i> (1601),
and that Chettle’s work in 1601 may have been the effecting of the
combination with <i>Thomas Merry</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_490" href="#FNanchor_490" class="label">[490]</a> Dr. Greg, following Mr. Fleay, identifies this with
Dekker’s <i>Whore of Babylon</i>, and as Time is a character in this
play, cites the purchase of ‘a Robe for tyme’ in April 1600 as a proof
that it was then performed. Time, however, might also have been a
character in <i>The Seven Wise Masters</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_491" href="#FNanchor_491" class="label">[491]</a> Possibly finished later and identical with the

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_492" href="#FNanchor_492" class="label">[492]</a> The payment-entry is cancelled. The play may have been
finished for another company, and be identical with the extant <i>Grim,
the Collier of Croydon</i>, or, <i>The Devil and his Dame</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_493" href="#FNanchor_493" class="label">[493]</a> Possibly the basis of Bird and Rowley’s <i>Judas</i> of

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_494" href="#FNanchor_494" class="label">[494]</a> It seems to me a little arbitrary of Dr. Greg to assume

on <i>1 The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>.</p>

recognizes the full significance of this when he suggests (Henslowe,
ii. 94) that Alleyn was back on the stage by 1598; cf. my criticism in
<i>M. L. R.</i> iv. 410. Dr. Greg relies mainly on the appearance of
his name in the plot of <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, which, he says,
‘almost certainly belongs to 1598’. But I can find no reason why it
should not belong to 1600–2; cf. p. 175.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_501" href="#FNanchor_501" class="label">[501]</a> Dr. Greg puts it in 1598, on the assumption that Alleyn
returned to the stage in that year. It might conceivably belong to
1597, between 18 Dec., when Bristow was bought, and 29 Dec., by which
day Alleyn had left. It cannot be later than Feb. 1602, by which month
Jones and Shaw had left. The prefix ‘M<sup>r</sup>’ allotted to Charles and Sam
is in favour of a date after their agreements on 16 Nov. 1598. Dr.
Greg’s argument (<i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 138) that Kendall’s agreement
expired 7 Dec. 1599 is not convincing, as there was nothing in it to
prevent him from staying on, and the satire of the play in Jonson’s
<i>Poetaster</i> of 1601, to which he refers, obviously tells in favour
of a date nearer to 1601 than 1598.</p>

as <i>The Rising</i>, although written later, was historically
<i>1 Cardinal Wolsey</i>. The entries are complicated. It is just
possible that the playwrights were working on an old play, for the
property-inventories of 1598 include an unexplained ‘Will Sommers
sewtte’ (cf. p. 168). A ‘W<sup>m</sup> Someres cotte’ was, however, bought for
<i>The Rising</i> on 27 May 1602.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

(<i>Revue des Provinces</i>, iv. 496), cites H. Ternaux in <i>Revue
Françoise et Étrangère</i>, i. 78, for statements that the head of the
English at Fontainebleau was Ganassa, who in Spain had had a mixed
company of English, Italians, and Spanish, and on 11 Jan. 1583 had a
share in the receipts of a troupe of English <i>volteadores</i>. I
have not been able to see the work of M. Ternaux, who does not inspire
confidence by calling Ganassa Juan instead of Alberto. There seems to
be nothing to connect Ganassa with the <i>volteadores</i> of 1583,
except the fact that the Corral de la Pacheca where they played was
leased to him for nine or ten years in 1574 (Rennert, 29), and they
may therefore have paid him rent. His troupe in 1581–2, as given
by Rennert, 479, consisted entirely of Italians, with two Spanish
musicians. He is said to have been in Spain in 1603 (Pellicer, i. 57,
72; Rennert, 30), but there is nothing to show that, if so, he went on
to France. But Héroard tells us that there was a Spanish rope-dancer
at Fontainebleau in 1604, and a very obscure passage in his diary
suggests that this Spaniard was really an Irishman. Irish marauders
(<i>voleurs</i>) were then giving trouble in Paris, which led Louis to
say ‘Ce voleur qui voloit sur la corde étoit Irlandois?’ and Héroard
comments, ‘Il étoit vrai; il accommoda le mot de voleur à l’autre
signification, il l’avoit vu voler à Fontainebleau’ (<i>Journal</i>, i.
90, 126).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1038" href="#FNanchor_1038" class="label">[1038]</a> Text by H. B. Wheatley, <i>On a Contemporary Drawing
of the Interior of the Swan Theatre, 1596</i> (<i>N. S. S. Trans.
1887–92</i>, 215), from <i>Utrecht Univ. Library MS. Var.</i> 355, ff.
131<sup>v</sup>, 132, with facsimile reproduction of drawing. The passage was
first made known by K. T. Gaedertz, <i>Zur Kenntniss der altenglischen
Bühne</i> (1888). The reproduction of the drawing published by Gaedertz
and further reproduced from him in many modern books is not an exact
facsimile; the only material difference is that the engraver has made
the figure at the door of the loft rather more obviously a man than
it is in the original. Letters of the early part of the seventeenth
century from de Witt to Buchell, who was his fellow-student at Leyden
in 1583, are also in the Utrecht Library (Gaedertz, 57). The last
sentence of the passage appears from ‘narrabat’ to be a report by
Buchell either of something not directly copied by him or of de Witt’s
conversation; but the rest is pretty clearly from ‘ea quae alio loco
a me notata sunt’ a verbatim extract from a manuscript of de Witt’s
own. If so, ‘adpinxi’ further shows that the eye-witness of de Witt and
not the imagination of Buchell is the source of the drawing. Gaedertz,
63, indeed suggests that the drawing is an original given by de Witt
to Buchell, but as Wheatley, 219, points out, this is impossible, as
the paper is the same as that used in the rest of the volume. There
remains the question of date. De Witt is traceable at Amsterdam in Nov.
1594, at Utrecht in the winters of 1595 and 1596, and in 1599, and
at Amsterdam again in March 1604 (Gaedertz, 58). His visit to London
obviously falls between Nov. 1594, when the Swan was still only an
intention, and Dec. 1598, when the Theatre was pulled down. Gaedertz,
55, puts it in the summer of 1596, largely because Shakespeare, whom
he thinks de Witt would certainly have mentioned if he had met him,
may have been in Stratford about that time. This is hopeless. Nor
does the further suggestion of Gaedertz that a lameness from which
de Witt was suffering in Dec. 1596 was due to his travels carry much
conviction. But he is not likely, before that year, to have appended
the words ‘A<sup>o</sup>. 1596’ to his notice of Sir John Burgh’s tomb. If this
is intended to be the date, not of his visit, but of the tomb, it is an
error. Camden, <i>Reges ... in Ecclesia ... West-monasterii sepulti</i>
(1600), gives the final words of the inscription as ‘G. B. A. M. P.
anno Dom. 1595’, and although the tomb itself has disappeared since
1868 and some modern guides date it 1594 or 1598, Camden is confirmed
by J. C[rull], <i>Antiquities of Westminster</i> (1711), 198. Burgh’s
death, also given on the monument, was 7 March ‘1594’. On the whole
1596 is the most probable date for de Witt’s visit. Arend van Buchell
was himself a traveller, and his <i>Diarium</i> has been edited (1907)
by G. Brom and L. A. van Langeraad. But he did not visit England.</p>

dictionary gives ‘zwaen’, which is perhaps what de Witt wrote.</p>

Tragedies, and Histories, for recreation. Whereof the one is called the
Courtein, the other the Theatre: both standing on the South-west side
towards the field’. This is omitted from the 1603 edition, probably
not so much, as has been suggested, because Stowe shared the Puritan
dislike of the stage, as because in 1603 the Theatre was gone and the
Curtain little used. Stowe’s draft (<i>c.</i> 1598) in <i>Harl. MS.</i>
538 runs, ‘Neare adjoyning are builded two houses for the shewe of
Activities, Comedies, tragedies and histories, for recreation. The one
of them is named the Curtayn in Holy Well, the other the Theatre.’ No
contemporary map shows the Theatre, although that of Agas (<i>c.</i>
1561) gives a good idea of the Halliwell district before it was built.
The representation from the seventeenth-century ‘Ryther’ map, given as
the Theatre by Baker, 135, is presumably the Curtain.</p>

authority. Under Burbadge’s lease all Giles Allen’s tenants in Holywell
were to have access to the well. Stowe, <i>Survey</i>, i. 15, describes
the holy well as ‘much decayed and marred with filthinesse purposely
laide there, for the heighthening of the ground for garden plots’. It
is clearly distinct from Dame Agnes a Cleere’s well, which was outside

the contempt of 16 Nov. 1590. The second, of 6 May 1592, apparently
corrects the first, by giving the date of the insult to the Lord
Admiral as ‘about a yere past’. The point is of importance, as bearing
upon the length of the stay of the Admiral’s and Strange’s (cf. ch.

that Ben Jonson ‘acted and wrote, but both ill, at the Green Curtaine,
a kind of nursery or obscure play-house, somewhere in the suburbes’ (I
thinke towards Shoreditch or Clarkenwell), and on that of Sir Edward
Shirburn that Jonson killed Marlowe, ‘on Bunhill, comeing from the
Green-Curtain play-house’. Hoxton, where Jonson killed Gabriel Spencer,
is of course not far from Bunhill, and both are in the Holywell
neighbourhood. Probably Aubrey, in giving a name to the theatre, is
babbling of green frieze, rather than green fields. Steevens and Malone
(<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 54) committed themselves to the view that ‘the
original sign hung out at this play-house was the painting of a curtain
striped’.</p>

‘1591’ to have been written in first, and the continuous account under
the date ‘1592’ added later, probably after Henslowe had changed the
year-date in his play-entries, which seems to have been on 6 May.</p>

river, which has since receded from its former limits; that the Globe
stood on the site of John Whatley’s windmill, which is at present used
for grinding colours; as I was assured by an intelligent manager of
Barclay’s brewhouse, which covers, in its ample range, part of Globe
Alley; and that Whatley’s wind mill stands due south from the western
side of Queenhythe by the compass, which I set for the express purpose
of ascertaining the relative bearings of the windmill to the opposite
objects on the Thames’; W. Wilson, <i>History and Antiquities of
Dissenting Churches</i> (1814), iv. 148, 175, ‘In former days there
stood here [in Globe Alley] a theatre called the “Globe”.... Near to
this place stood the meeting-house.... Its dissolution took place
about the year 1752.... It is at present used for warehousing goods.
A mill was also erected over it for the purpose of grinding bones’;
R. Wilkinson, <i>Londina Illustrata</i> (1819), i. 135, ‘Upon the
disuse of the theatre, its site ... was formed into a meeting-house....
Afterwards a mill was erected here to grind bones; and it is at present
appropriated for the purpose of grinding stones and similar materials’.
The plan, however, which accompanies Wilkinson’s text, assigns the
theatre to an improbable site some way west of the meeting-house. The
Globe Alley meeting-house was built in 1672; it appears in a list of
1683, and is marked on Rocque’s map of 1746 on Rendle’s favourite
site. Wilson only says the meeting-house was near the Globe; Wilkinson
identifies the sites. Chalmers mentions the windmill, but not the
meeting-house. I may add that a line drawn south from the west of
Queenhithe would pass west of any possible site for the Globe. Malone’s
‘nearly opposite to Friday Street, Cheapside’ (<i>Variorum</i>, iii.
63) can also only be approximate.</p>

Middlesex justice in 1591, with whom the Lord Mayor was joined because
a City company was involved (Dasent, xx. 245, 283). Young and others

inhabitants, on a building matter in 1591 (Dasent, xxi. 337). At a time

print it, although he mentions it (<i>New Facts</i>, 9) in connexion
with a forged Privy Council order which he dates 23 Dec. 1579. Wallace,

Stowe (1598), i. 313; ii. 11, with the maps described in the <i>Bibl.
Note</i> to ch. xvi, and the modern ordnance maps. The earlier maps are
largely picturesque, and notably place far too much of the precinct on
the east of Water Lane. But they seem to preserve certain details, such
as the arches over the north to south highway. The old lines of the
roads appear to have been preserved at the rebuilding after the great
fire of 1666. I have added some details from other sources.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1486" href="#FNanchor_1486" class="label">[1486]</a> The 1586 documents in Stowe (1720), i. 3. 178, state
that the prior held of the lord of St. John’s, ‘who did make the
bridge at the Thames’. Feuillerat, <i>Eliz.</i> 454, however, quotes
a Declared Account of 1550 for ‘the ereccion and buyldynge ... of
two bridges thone at the Blackfreers and thother at the Temple’.
Under Elizabeth the liberty maintained the bridge as well as that at
Bridewell (<i>Lansd. MS.</i> 155, f. 80<sup>v</sup>). The tenure from St. John’s
is also alleged (1587) in Dasent, xv. 137. It is rather curious that
in an endorsement of the survey of St. John’s in 1586–7 (Feuillerat,
<i>Eliz.</i> 47) that house, although in Clerkenwell, is described,
perhaps by a slip, as in the Blackfriars.</p>

which must have been just east of the school-house. Possibly they
formed part of the provincial’s lodging. They are shown in a plan
of <i>c.</i> 1670–80 (Clapham, 71), and their condition in 1900 was
carefully recorded (Clapham, 69, 70, 78). Only a fragment of wall is
now <i>in situ</i>, just north of what is now the west end of Ireland
Yard, but appears on the seventeenth-century plan as Cloister Court. It
must, however, have run out from the south-east corner of the cloister
towards the east. The name Cloister Court has now passed to a yard
farther south.</p>

probably from the Lyly prologues and the reference in Gosson, <i>P.
C.</i> 188, of the existence of the earlier Blackfriars play-house, and
to have dated it, by a singular coincidence, in 1576. He knew nothing
of the real facts, but inferred (<i>H. E. D. P.</i> i. 219) that the
undated petition of the Blackfriars inhabitants, which is really of
1596, was of 1576, on the strength of a reference in it to a banishment
of the players from the City, which an incorrect endorsement on a
<i>Lansdowne MS.</i> (cf. App. D, No. lxxv) had led him to place in
1575. This did not prevent him from also assigning the petition, with
a forged reply from the players, to 1596 (cf. p. 508). He proceeded
to forge (<i>a</i>) an order dated 23 Dec. 1579 for the toleration
of Leicester’s men at the Blackfriars (<i>New Facts</i>, 9), and
(<i>b</i>) a memorial by Shakespeare and others as Queen’s men and

‘the more to strengthen the service, the boys daily wearing out, it was
considered that house would be as fit for ourselves, and so purchased
the lease remaining from Evans with our money, and placed men players,
which were Hemings, Condall, Shakspeare, etc.’. They also say that the
players had their shares ‘of us for nothing’. Very likely they paid no
fine, but they had to pay their quota towards rent. It is reasonable
to infer that Thomas Evans was a relative and nominee of Henry Evans.
Kirkham’s allegation in the 1612 litigation that Henry Evans had shared
in the Blackfriars profits during the past four years (Fleay, 225) was

Cuthbert and William Burbadge for 14 years’ purchase of the rent of £50
reserved to them by lease, (<i>b</i>) £1,134 for 14 years’ purchase of

others haue in the benefits thereof’, and for compensation for removal.

Buck was long dead. A third valuation published by Collier, in which

before 1608. The King’s Revels may well have started by 1607. He also

<p><a id="Footnote_1704" href="#FNanchor_1704" class="label">[1704]</a> For the classical sense of <i>Scaena</i>, cf.
the passage from Vitruvius quoted in vol. iii, p. 3. Florio,
<i>Dictionary</i> (1598), s.v. <i>Scena</i>, ‘a skaffold, a pavillion,
or forepart of a theatre where players make them readie, being trimmed
with hangings, out of which they enter upon the stage’, points to the
identity of scene and tire-house front. This structure has therefore
precisely the double function of the ‘domus’ of the court plays; cf.
ch. xix. I owe the quotation to Graves, 15, who adds, <i>The Englysshe
Mancyne upon the foure Cardynale Vertues</i> (<i>c.</i> 1520), ‘a
disgyser yt goeth into a secret corner callyd a sene of the pleyinge
place to chaunge his rayment’, and Palsgrave, <i>Acolastus</i> (1540),
prol., ‘our scenes, that is to saye, our places appoynted for our
players to come forth of’. The English ‘Mancyne’ is a translation,
earlier than A. Barclay’s, of Dominic Mancini’s <i>De Quatuor
Virtutibus</i> (1516), and the original has only ‘Histrio, qui in
scaenam vadit’. The notion of scena as not a mere wall, but a shelter
for performers, is mediaeval, and appears to go back to an early
definition from σκῆνος, a hut or tent, found, e. g., side by side with
the regular mediaeval misunderstanding of the classical art of acting
in Hugutius, <i>Liber Derivationum</i>, ‘Scena est umbraculum siue
locus obumbratus in theatro et cortinis coopertus similis tabernaculis
mercenariorum, quae sunt asseribus vel cortinis opertae, et secundum
hoc scena potest dici a scenos, quod est domus, quae in modum domus
erat constructa. In umbraculo latebant personae larvatae, quae ad
vocem recitatoris exigebantur ad gestus faciendos’; cf. Herrmann, 280,
W. Cloetta, <i>Komödie und Tragödie im Mittelalter</i> (1890), 38;
<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 208. It is revised on humanist lines by
Jodocus Badius Ascensius in the <i>Praenotamenta</i> to his Terence of
1502, ‘Intra igitur theatrum ab una parte opposita spectatoribus erant
scenae et proscenia, id est loca lusoria ante scenas facta. Scenae
autem erant quaedam umbracula seu absconsoria, in quibus abscondebantur
lusores, donec exire deberent. Ante autem scenas erant quaedam
tabulata, in quibus personae qui exierant ludebant.’</p>

offer to employ a dismissed ‘gatherer’ as ‘a nessessary atendaunt on

(<i>Var.</i> iii. 112; Herbert, 74) issued a warrant of protection for
Nicholas Underhill, Robert Pallant, John Rhodes, and eighteen others
‘all imployed by the kings maiesties servantes in theire quallity of
playinge as musitions and other necessary attendantes’. In <i>Devil’s
Charter</i> (1607), 3016, is the s. d. ‘Alexander vnbraced betwixt two
Cardinalls in his study looking vpon a booke, whilst a groome draweth
the curtaine’. Is this ‘groom’ a character or an ‘attendant’? In any
case attendants were naturally, with musicians and even ‘gatherers’ (on
whom cf. ch. xi), used at need for supernumeraries; cf. the gatherers
in the <i>Frederick and Basilea</i> plot (1597, <i>H. P.</i> 136) and
<i>2 If You Know Not Me</i> (1606), p. 297, ‘Enter ... the waits in
sergeants’ gowns’. The long list of men and boys in the procession
at the end of <i>1 Tamar Cham</i> (1602, <i>H. P.</i> 148) must have
taxed all such resources. For the use of boys as attendants, cf.
<i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 65, ‘Ha’ you none of your

King’s are ‘to entertain a little more time, and to abridge the
not-received custom of music in our theatre’. But ‘abridge’ only
means shorten, and there are s. ds. for music between the acts of
<i>Sejanus</i> (Globe, <i>1603</i>) and in the plot of <i>Dead Man’s
Fortune</i> (Admiral’s, <i>c.</i> 1590, <i>H. P.</i> 133); cf. Dekker,
<i>Belman of London</i> (1608, <i>Works</i>, iii. 76), ‘These were
appointed to be my Actes, in this goodly Theater, the musicke betweene,
were the Singers of the Wood’. But such evidence is rare, and Lawrence,
i. 75, and Cowling, 67, do not discriminate sufficiently the practice
of the public theatres from that of the private theatres on the one
hand and the early neo-classic court plays on the other. Here music
is an integral part of the <i>intermedii</i> or dumb-shows, which are
little more than survivals in the full-blown public drama; cf. F. A.

<i>Four Prentices</i>, prol., ‘Do you not know that I am the prologue?
Do you not see the long black velvet coat upon my back? Have I not all

Dekker, <i>Satiromastix</i>, epist., ‘In steed of the trumpets sounding
thrice, before the play begin, it shall not be amisse ... first to
beholde this short Comedy of Errors’; <i>G. H. B.</i> (cf. App. H),

upon point to enter’; <i>E. M. O.</i> (Q<sub>1</sub>), 107, ‘Inductio, sono

similar arrangement (F<sub>1</sub>) in the private house plays <i>Cynthia’s

replaced by more elaborate music; cf. <i>1 Ant. Mellida</i>, ind. 1,

ind. 1 (s. d.), ‘Before the music sounds for the Act’; <i>C. Revels</i>

this is the origin of the ‘first’, ‘second’, and ‘third’ (or ‘curtain
tune’) music of the Restoration and eighteenth-century overtures,
described by Lawrence, ii. 155. Exceptionally the prologue in Percy’s

these, although early plays, are in late prints, and the other examples
of a music-room ‘above’ given by Lawrence, i. 91, are Caroline. Jasper
Mayne says of Jonson (1638, <i>Jonsonus Virbius</i>), ‘Thou laid’st no
sieges to the music-room’. My own impression is that when the lord’s
room over the tire-house was disused by spectators (cf. p. 537) it
became indifferently available for actors and for music, and that here,
rather than, as is possible, higher still in the scenic wall, was the
normal place for the seventeenth-century music, when it was not needed
elsewhere, or the space needed for other purposes. The introduction of
the high proscenium arch at the Restoration caused difficulties, and
various experiments were tried in placing the music above (Lawrence,
i. 91, 161; ii. 160; W. G. Keith, <i>The Designs for the First Movable
Scenery on the English Public Stage</i> in <i>Burlington Magazine</i>,

<p class="transnote">Transcriber’s Notes:<br />

1. Obvious printers’, punctuation and spelling errors have been
corrected silently.<br />

2. Where necessary, original spelling has been retained.

3. Where hyphenation is in doubt, it has been retained as in the original.<br />

4. Hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions of the same words have been
retained as in the original.

5. Some words seem to have been written as one word, e.g.
thexecutor. These have been retained as in the original.<br />

6. The heading hierarchy used follows the original publication and consequently in some
chapters the h4 level has been skipped.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
